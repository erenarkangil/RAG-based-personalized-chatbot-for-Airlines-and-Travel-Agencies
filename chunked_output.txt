Thai Airways International Booking Policy

Issued: 21November 2019 Issue No. 24 /19

Dear Industry Partners,

To ensure seating availability for customers, Thai Airways International would like to ensure correct procedures are being adhered to regarding the use of flight segment bookings. It has become necessary to audit travel agency transactions effective from 01 December 2019 in the THAI GDS system identifying duplications, fictitious, test and speculative bookings.

The following describes examples of misuse; • Duplicate Flight Segments — booked in separate PNRs or in same bookings for same passenger names.

The following describes examples of misuse; • Fictitious Bookings — False names, possibly for training purposes or waiting for correct name.

The following describes examples of misuse; • Invalid Ticket Numbers — Using invalid ticket numbers that do not relate to a valid ticket linked to the booking in order to retain a booking and avoid auto cancellation.

--- Chunk 2 from Agents-Advice-24-19-Thai-Airways-International-Booking-Policy-21NOV19 (1).pdf ---
The following describes examples of misuse; • Invalid Ticket Numbers — Using invalid ticket numbers that do not relate to a valid ticket linked to the booking in order to retain a booking and avoid auto cancellation.

The following describes examples of misuse; • Space Churning & Cancellations — Excessive cancelling and rebooking in the same flight booking class in order to reset ticketing time limits. Repeated waitlisting. We require agents to ensure unwanted waitlists are cancelled promptly and waitlists are kept to a minimum.

The following describes examples of misuse; • Unproductive Segments — ensure inhouse queues are checked daily and update any confirmed waitlists, schedule changes, flight cancellation or booking messages for status codes; HX, NO, SC, WK, WL, UN, US.

The following describes examples of misuse;

Agent Debit Memo Policy (ADM):

A fee of USD10 per passenger per segment will apply for booking misuse. Service fee, if applicable, will be charged in addition to the ADM.

We thank you for your continued support of Thai Airways International.

AirAudit: Intelligent Audit Solution for Airlines Reducing Revenue Leakage & Improving Operational Efficiency

i \By SS

Sethuraman Janardhanan, PhD Rammurty Kommajosyula

Introduction

In recent times, the airline industry is focusing on ways to increase profitability, using appropriate service enhancement techniques, marketing scheduling and revenue management strategies. One such strategy is Make-easy-Travel. In line with this system, customers can book, cancel or make any transaction related to air travel, through airline Central Reservation System (CRS), online systems or through travel agents /Global Distribution System (GDS’s).

Although the airline industry has benefitted due to a significant increase in sales with the help of travel agents/GDS’s; it has also led to sizeable revenue losses due to improper booking practices. Revenue leakage through GDS can be defined as the difference between the expected GDS bookings and the actual amount that the airlines eventually receives from GDS. This is mainly due to inefficiency of the GDS staff or due to travel agents or customers who deliberately abuse the airline reservation system.

--- Chunk 5 from air-audit-intelligent-audit-solution-for-airlines (1).pdf ---
According to industry reports, the average revenue loss due to NO SHOW passengers and late cancellations amounts to 15%. In some sectors/ connections it even comes up to 30% 40%. Passengers buying tickets from different travel agencies are found to be cancelling tickets without any apparent reason, and the cancellation does not follow any specific pattern either. This trend, however, is costing the airline companies dearly as they are not only losing the ticket amount but are also forced to pay the extra cost to GDS. An airlines’ distribution strategy helps to determine the type of content to sell in a particular channel along with the optimum price, time and cost. So from an airlines point of view, it becomes very important to pay attention to the distribution of sales as well as the sales and refund figures.

The Opportunities & Challenges

The major objective of any airline company is to: • Understand their customer behavior and the need to maximize their client satisfaction

The major objective of any airline company is to: • Identify new growth opportunities, and increase their market value

The major objective of any airline company is to: • Reduce unnecessary distribution costs and inventory spoilage.

The major objective of any airline company is to:

The airline industry is currently facing a lot of challenges in achieving these objectives, due to agencies indulging in fraudulent activities.

Impact of Improper booking practices: • Results in less choice and non-availability of seats. This leads to customer dissatisfaction.

Impact of Improper booking practices: • Leads to inaccurate forecasting in areas such as airline market, growth opportunities and revenue.

Impact of Improper booking practices: • Increases unnecessary costs like GDS distribution costs, maintenance costs etc.

Impact of Improper booking practices:

The as a whole, wants to prevent the unnecessary GDS distribution costs and inventory spoilage, caused by the agencies’ non-compliant booking practices. But most of the airlines find it difficult to understand all of the Billing Information Data Tape (BIDT) data, as well as analyze and identify fraudulent activities.

Sales Data Exchange System Specification and Implementation Guide

Section 1: Introduction

Section 1 Introduction

The Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO) Sales Data Exchange Service—also commonly known as ISR (Industry Sales Record) which includes TCN (Transmission Control Number), BSP (Billing Settlement Plan) and CAT data inputs—is a clearing house service open to all carriers (both air and ground transportation), financial institutions (for example, credit card companies), and system providers regardless of size or nationality. The system provides data switching services between customers that have contracted bilaterally for the exchange of data.

Section 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to provide documentation of the exchange format for those parties (or future parties) participating in the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange.

--- Chunk 15 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Section 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to provide documentation of the exchange format for those parties (or future parties) participating in the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange.

This format is an attempt to document all known (worldwide) data requirements that carriers will need to exchange in the near future. No one system provider can supply all the elements proposed in this specification, so individual contracting parties will need to document the level of compliance to the specification. However, it is expected that system providers will supply the mandatory and optional data elements described in Section 3.3.

This specification provides for codesharing encoding and proration of coupons by external systems. Coding and specifications for these enhanced features will be documented as these systems are developed.

Section 1.2 Responsible Party

The information contained in the Sales Data Exchange System Specification and Implementation Guide is subject to constant review and is updated periodically. It is the responsibility of ATPCO to keep the document current. To assist in this process, direct inquiries and comments to rev-accounting@atpco.net

--- Chunk 16 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Section 1.3. Change Control

A summary of changes will be published at the beginning of each revised publication of the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange System Specification and Implementation Guide.

Section 1.4 Examples

All examples depicted in this specification guide are fictitious and are not intended to represent any actual business relationship or agreement.

Section 1.5 Industry Sales Record

Note that all data elements and records relating only to ISR (that is, not present in TCN-only ISR or in the TCN standalone product) are shaded gray throughout the guide. These records and elements are shown in the record layouts in Section 7 and their element details listed in the Glossary (Section 10).

All new customers will join the Sales Data Exchange as ISR receivers. Further details on the ISR process can be found in Section 5.4.

Section 2 ATPCO Sales Data Exchange Overview

--- Chunk 17 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
All new customers will join the Sales Data Exchange as ISR receivers. Further details on the ISR process can be found in Section 5.4.

Section 2 ATPCO Sales Data Exchange Overview

The ATPCO Sales Data Exchange is a switching center (clearing house) and a value-added service (see list of Value-Added processes in Section 5.3 and further descriptions in Section 9) for settlement, revenue accounting, marketing, credit card, and ticketing data transmitted between carriers. The following schema illustrates the flow of data.

Figure 2-A: Business Partners and Data Flow for ATPCO Sales Data Exchange

The system was designed to support the bilateral agreements established between recipients of the data and system providers supplying the data.

For TCN 4.05-generated records that use an address label as described in Section 4.2, Open Addressing, and are a part of the ATPCO codesharing service, ATPCO reports counts to the system provider and the marketing carrier (see Section 9.1).

Section 3: Data Representation

Section 3 Data Representation

Section 3.1 Alphabetic and Alphanumeric Elements

Alphabetic and alphanumeric elements shall contain left-aligned strings of characters with trailing blanks. If there is no entry, the entire element is blank. Facsimile fields must be reported precisely as they were generated by the ticketing system.

Section 3.2. Numeric Elements

Numeric elements shall be right aligned with leading zeros. If there is no entry, the entire element is filled with zeros. When the data has passed through the Net Remit Data Removal process (see Section 9.2), the entire element is filled with nines.

In numeric value amount elements, the decimal point shall be defined by the CUTP, which relates to these specific elements. The Glossary (Section 10) lists all numeric values expressed in this way and refers to the appropriate CUTP within the transaction.

No element shall be packed.

Low values and special characters should not be provided.

Section 3.3. Data Validation

Section 3.3.1 Mandatory, Conditional, and Optional Status

The following conventions apply to data element descriptions:

Where an element is annotated with status M in the Glossary (Section 10), the data is mandatory for proper processing and must be provided at all times. Mandatory elements may also include cross-edit conditions that provide for correct formatting of the data.

A mandatory element that is within a non-mandatory record must be provided when the conditions for providing that record are met. If the record is not provided, the mandatory element will also not be provided.

Where an element is annotated with status O in the Glossary (Section 10), the data will be provided whenever available to the system provider.

A data element will never be expressed as “Conditional.” It is either required in all cases (mandatory) or not required in all cases (optional).

--- Chunk 20 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
A data element will never be expressed as “Conditional.” It is either required in all cases (mandatory) or not required in all cases (optional).

Certain records have associated conditions; for example, the Record 6 (Proration Record) is supplied on the condition that the sale has been prorated. An element may be mandatory within a conditional record. Elements may also be optional within a mandatory record. See the Glossary (Section 10) for further detail at the element level.

Section 3.3.2 Application of Cross-Edits

Where an element or a record has an associated cross-edit, the data should conform to the check as described. These cross-edits are used at the record and data element levels to audit and report on data quality standards within reported files.

Section 3.4 Sequence Number

--- Chunk 21 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Sales Data Exchange System Specification and Implementation Guide

Section 3: Data Representation

Section 3.4 Sequence Number

The Sequence Number provides the receiver of data from ATPCO (that is, it is not used for incoming files from system providers to ATPCO) with an integrity test to ensure that all records are received. With the start of a transmission, the Sequence Number is set to 00000001 and increased by increments of 1 for each record.

In cases where not all sequences, as identified in the record header total count, are received, then operations evaluation must be performed and the data may need to be resent or retransmitted from ATPCO.

Section 3.5 Dates

Date data elements are represented by various formats, such as these:

Four-digit numeric dates shall be in the format of MMYY, where

MM is the two-digit number of the month, and

YY is the last two digits of the year

Example: 1112 is November 2012, as in data element Expiry Date (EXDA)

Five-character alphanumeric dates shall be in the format DDMMM, where DD is the day of the month, and

MMN is the first three letters of the month in English.

Example: 12NOV is 12 November, as in data element Flight Date (FTDA)

--- Chunk 22 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
MMN is the first three letters of the month in English.

Example: 12NOV is 12 November, as in data element Flight Date (FTDA)

Eight-digit numeric dates shall be in the format of YYYYMMDD, where

YYYY is the four-digit year,

MM is the two-digit number of the month, and

DD is the day of the month.

Example: 20121112 is 12 November 2012, as in data element Date of Issue (DAIS)

Section 3.6 Signed Data Elements

Data elements are unsigned. The sign of the data element must be determined by the Transaction Code (TRNC). For example, a ticket sale (TKTT) implies positive amounts for the Fare (FNUM), Equivalent Fare (EQFN), and Tax/Fee/Charge (TMFA) data elements, and negative amounts for deductions such as commission (COAM, EFCO). A refund incorporates negative amounts for Fare, Equivalent Fare, and Tax/Fee/Charge data elements, and positive amounts for deductions such as commission. The remittance amount (REMT)—that is, the final settled amount between the agency and the airline—may be positive or negative for any given transaction.

Section 3: Data Representation

Section 3.7 Facsimile Data Elements

Data elements that are defined as facsimiles contain data exactly as printed on the document or as entered by the ticketing agent for electronic tickets. ATA and IATA Ticketing Resolutions govern the format of the data element. The concept of facsimile fields does not strictly govern the creation of electronic tickets because there is no print routine for this ticket type; however, these fields are generated by the system provider and may be used for the printing of itinerary receipts or in display routines.

Figure 4-A: Input Records into ATPCO Sales Data Exchange

On the inbound transmission to the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange from a system provider, carrier, or ticketing system, the first record must always be the Transmission Header Record. This Transmission Header Record contains information to allow ATPCO to identify the type and origin of data and provides for additional controls.

--- Chunk 26 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
After the Transmission Header Record, the rest of the transmission can be considered a simple postal system. ATPCO addresses the recipient carriers in the Address Label and attaches the ticketing data. ATPCO generates and propagates ticketing records by encoding the Address Label to codesharing and alliance partners upon instructions from the marketing carrier. An envelope is considered a complete ticketing transaction addressed to one or more addressee. ATPCO, upon receiving the envelope, reads the addressees and sends a copy of the envelope to each. The Address Label has the ability to send the envelope to up to 14 different carriers. As ATPCO retransmits the envelope, it drops the Address Label.

--- Chunk 27 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
The system provider, carrier, or ticketing system can distribute their data by using either the addressing the Address Label or ATPCO’s Open Addressing. ATPCO’s codesharing service has secondary responsibility for addressing the Address Label on certain tickets, if there is proper authority from the marketing carrier (initiated by the presence of a signed TCN Codeshare and Data Agreement). The system provider, carrier, or ticketing system is responsible for identifying carriers eligible to receive the ticketing data (validating carrier, any carrier in the routing, possible codesharing or alliance carriers, and any carrier participating as the credit card vendor, or the accounting carrier). The system provider populates the 42-byte Address Label with codes of eligible carriers with whom they have a bilateral agreement and attaches the Address Label to the data in the envelope.

Figure 4-B: Carrier Address on Front of ATPCO Record

All subscribers identified in this 42-byte label receive a copy of the ticketing information contained in the attached record. The 3-byte elements contain the twoor three-character Carrier Code representing validating carriers, carriers who take part in the itinerary, or carriers who are contractors of the credit cards. Each of the subscribers represented in Bytes 1 through 42 must be a party to the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange.

Open Addressing

Open Addressing opens the address envelope and includes all marketing airlines specified on any of the flight coupons within the Record 5 of the Industry Sales Record so that they will also get a copy of this sales transaction. Performing Open Addressing once at ATPCO eliminates the dependency on the carrier-supplied addressing envelope, allowing for distribution to all marketing carriers in the itinerary. Open Addressing expands coverage for all customers without requiring additional development effort from carriers who supply data.

--- Chunk 29 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
The marketing carriers identified in the Open Addressing process are in addition to any airline or company that was supplied as part of the original sales transaction address envelope. Sales transactions will be generated only for carriers that participate in the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange process.

All standard Sales Data Exchange processes will be performed on transactions generated from Open Addressing, such as codeshare and private data masking.

The Open Addressing process will occur by default for all carrier-supplied sales, unless the supplying airline requests otherwise. With this implementation, airlines no longer have to complete the addressing envelope on the sales transaction unless they are addressing transactions to a company other than the marketing or operating carriers on the ticket (for example, credit card companies). ATPCO requests that carriers continue to send the credit card company on the address envelope.

Section 4.3 File Structure from ATPCO

ATPCO’s Sales Data Exchange switches the data coming from the various system providers, carriers, and ticketing systems. The system directs ticketing records to subscribers (or parties) who are addressed on the inbound records. The Addressing Label is dropped by the system after the ticketing records have been written to the Subscriber Transmission Queue. After all scheduled inbound transmissions have been received by the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange and records have been switched to the Subscriber Transmission Queue, ATPCO initiates outbound transmissions to the subscribers. If an inbound transmission is late in being received by ATPCO, its data is held over to the next outbound transmission cycle.

The outbound ISR/TCN file is not sorted.

The “merge” ISR/TCN file containing ATPCO Value-Added data, including proration records, requires sorting in order to integrate the processed data with the original sale record. The file is sorted by Ticket Number (TDNR), TCN Number (TCNR), and Record ID (RCID).

When all sorting has completed, the file is sequenced from 00000001 to nin increments of 1 number per record output, where rn is the complete number of records output in the file.

Any test file sent to any recipient by ATPCO that contains actual live ticketing data—and therefore is very likely to contain live credit card numbers—will be masked by ATPCO prior to any manual processing. All files containing credit card data must undergo a masking process before being processed in a test environment by ATPCO. The specifications for masking the data can be found in Section 5.5. ATPCO uses this process to comply with global Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

--- Chunk 33 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Test files containing production data (that is, including live credit card information) must be sent to ATPCO by FTP, and preferably by Secure Socket Layer File Transfer Protocol (SSL FTP, also known as FTPS) or Secure Zip. The use of e-mail for the transmission of sales data to or from ATPCO is strictly prohibited.

Further details on file transmission standards can be obtained on request from revaccounting@atpco.net.

Section 5 ATPCO Processing

ATPCO reads each record and directs the output to the carriers addressed in the label. In the process of writing the records to their proper output queue, ATPCO

1. Accounts for receipt of the records.

2. Accounts for the output of the records.

3. Collects and processes transactions for Neutral Fare Proration services.

4. Matches records against a codesharing table and copies and distributes records to Sales Data Exchange recipients for marketing carriers who have authorized copies to be made to the operating carrier.

--- Chunk 34 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
4. Matches records against a codesharing table and copies and distributes records to Sales Data Exchange recipients for marketing carriers who have authorized copies to be made to the operating carrier.

5. Copies and distributes records to Sales Data Exchange recipients found in the itinerary who were not in the address label. This distribution only occurs for files received from Carrier Internal systems (see Section 2).

6. Assigns sequential numbers and outputs detail records to Sales Data Exchange recipients.

Value-added processing is described in more detail in Section 9, ATPCO Value-Added Processing.

All time is calculated using US eastem time. Input files must be received by ATPCO no later than noon US eastern time to be included in that day’s processing. Any data received after the cutoff is processed in the next day’s cycle. It is ATPCO’s goal to distribute the data no later than 1800 hours US eastem time.

Section 5.4 Industry Sales Record Process

Section 5.4.1 General Business Purpose

The general business purpose of the ISR is to ensure that recipients of the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange product get the highest possible coverage and quality of sales data transactions for use in automated processing. Ticket transactions are reported through multiple formats for different business purposes, and therefore each source also has some common and some unique data elements. Today, three sources of sales data are recognized:

1. TCN, used for quick and accurate marketing data at the ticket level and interline billing

3. Electronic ticket, used for operational purposes such as check-in

--- Chunk 37 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
1. TCN, used for quick and accurate marketing data at the ticket level and interline billing

3. Electronic ticket, used for operational purposes such as check-in

The concept of the ISR is to match and merge this data where possible in order to create transactions that contain the best data from all sources. The ISR employs technology to process the first two of the above three sources, and ATPCO is currently evaluating the inclusion of electronic ticket data into the Sales Data Exchange.

Section 5.4.2 Data Provision

The Industry Sales Record product is an enhancement to the TCN process that uses sales transactions from multiple sources to create a standard output for customer carriers. Three sources of data can be leveraged by this process:

TCN 4.05: Sent by various ticketing systems, which include carrier in-house reservations systems, carrier-hosted reservations systems, system providers commonly referred to as “global distribution systems” and other host ticket systems for travel agency sales.

2. BSP HOT Version 20.1 and above: Sent by the validating (also known as selling or validating) carrier to ATPCO.

--- Chunk 38 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
2. BSP HOT Version 20.1 and above: Sent by the validating (also known as selling or validating) carrier to ATPCO.

A full and current list of participant providers can be found on the ATPCO Web site in the Sales Data Exchange product pages (http://www.atpco.net/atpco/products/sde_community.shtml).

Section 5.4.3 TCN Processing for ISR

Records are received in version 4.05 format from many data sources, and all will contain an address label (described in Section 4.2.1) showing the intended recipient airline. ATPCO enhances this address label by sending each transaction through the ATPCO Codeshare Process (Section 9.1), adding any relevant operating carriers who require the transaction for interline billing purposes. With airline carrier internal system files, we also add participant marketing carriers that were not originally in the address label.

If any recipient in the enhanced address label is identified as an ISR customer, then two processes will occur:

1. the entire ticket transaction is loaded once into a staging table.

2. one row per recipient airline is loaded into an addressing table to control the distribution of the transaction.

--- Chunk 39 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
1. the entire ticket transaction is loaded once into a staging table.

2. one row per recipient airline is loaded into an addressing table to control the distribution of the transaction.

3. Check the form code of the ticket (TDNR positions 4-6) to determine whether that form code is used for agency sales.

4. Check that the first flight date (Record 5, FTDA) is after the intended release date of the ticket.

If all the above criteria are met, the release date for the address label is set according to a table held at recipient level per country. This is because only one copy of the ticket is held in order to standardize the data that each customer receives.

If any of the above criteria are not met, then the ticket transaction will be set for immediate release. This effectively means that it will be released in subscriptions for that same day (that is, at 1230 hours US eastern time). Otherwise, the transaction will be released for processing at the sooner of the following conditions:

--- Chunk 40 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
During this process, if any transactions match the ticket number, agency code but mismatch the transaction code, they will be considered sales and their associated cancels will be merged together into one outbound transaction.

The header records for each constructed file are loaded into a table in order to

2. prevent duplicate files from being processed into the Sales Data Exchange

The second stage is to create an address label for each transaction, which is performed by

1. addressing the transaction to the validating carrier (TDNR positions 1-3)

2. addressing the transaction to all marketing carriers in the itinerary record (MCAR)

3. addressing the transaction to all operating carriers decoded from the ATPCO Codeshare Table from the marketing carrier (MCAR) and flight number (FTNR) in the itinerary record

Section 5.4.5 ISR Subscription Processing

During the standard Sales Data Exchange processing cycle, which begins at 1300 hours US eastern time, outbound files are created for ISR customers based on the input data files and processing described above. Files are created using

2. ISRaddress and staging tables

--- Chunk 41 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
2. ISRaddress and staging tables

3. Loop files, because the customer may elect not to receive data 7 days per week (if the customer only receives files on Monday to Friday, files for Saturday and Sunday are processed as normal but held in a “loop file” until the next outbound customer file (Monday at 1300 hours).

Five ticket constructions (or "data foundations”) are possible from the sale-to-sale merge process within ISR:

Constructed from TCN and BSP merged >

FwoN

Constructed from BSP only

a Constructed from TCN only

Constructed from BSP-only sale with integrated cancel >

The construction of the ISR record will be sent to the recipient in the data element Data Foundation (FNDT) on the Record 01.

Section 5.5.1 Credit Card

ATPCO processing is built to take account of the sensitivity of passenger credit card information that may appear on the processed sales record. In order to protect the credit card information, ATPCO processing performs the following steps:

1. All inbound files containing sales data are scanned for certain triggers which indicate that credit card information may be present in the transaction.

All inbound files are locked using Secure Zip.

Where credit card data is found, characters are encrypted based on the following methodology:

a. If Form of Payment Type (FPTP) = CC, CH, CL, DF, DT, EF, PB, TC or VD, then encrypt the related FPAC bytes 7-19.

b. If any Form of Payment Type (FPTP) = CC, CH, CL, DF, DT, EF, PB, TC, VD, or EX, then encrypt all instances of FPIN bytes 1-50.

--- Chunk 43 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
b. If any Form of Payment Type (FPTP) = CC, CH, CL, DF, DT, EF, PB, TC, VD, or EX, then encrypt all instances of FPIN bytes 1-50.

c. If any Form of Payment Type (FPTP) = CC, CH, CL, DF, DT, EF, PB, TC, VD, or EX, scan the Fare Calculation Area (FRCA) fields for recognizable credit card number pattems, and encrypt bytes 7-14 of the number found. Note that this generally occurs only for US-issued ATB1 ticket (or ATB1 E-ticket) stock.

The encryption key is securely stored and is accessible only to an administrator.

5. The original plain text file is deleted from ATPCO servers in the FTP job.

The above steps mean that no credit card information is available to ATPCO employees at any time.

For any ATPCO employee to view any sales data file (for example to analyze issues with customer data), a data masking utility must be run so that the credit card information is completely destroyed.

According to customer preference, the sales data is either decrypted during the outbound FTP process (and the original deleted) or the decrypted characters are each replaced with a letter X, a process known as masking, to completely destroy the credit card data references.

--- Chunk 44 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
ATPCO also encourages secure transmission of data, and authorizes the following methods for transmission of sales data into ATPCO:

For the protection of cardholder information within your sales data file (PCI Compliance), ATPCO offers two options. You can use either FTPS (SSL FTP) or SFTP (SSH FTP). Standard FTP is not allowed.

FTPS

Allow ATPCO IP Address 12.37.153.25 and our data connection ports 10000-10019 for SSL.

Use Explicit SSL; we don’t support Implicit SSL

Must use EPSV.

We have a well-known Thawte certificate; if you require our certificate you can download it from Thawte.

ATPCO FTP account.

If ATPCO will be pushing files to you using FTPS, the public portion of your SSL Certificate must be received by ATPCO before files can be transmitted. If you use a known and trusted CA, please let us know and your certificate is not needed.

SFTP

Use port 22.

ATPCO will need to know if you will use password or key authentication. If key, then you must send your RSA key to ATPCO (dnettsw@atpco.net).

It may take up to 3 business days to set up your current account to use SFTP. If you do not have an account, it will take 3 business days to create and set one up for you.

--- Chunk 45 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
It may take up to 3 business days to set up your current account to use SFTP. If you do not have an account, it will take 3 business days to create and set one up for you.

All files must be compressed using PKZip or gzip compatible compression.

Customers may choose to receive files with data masked per PCI-DSS standards.

Section 6: Record Structure by Transaction

Section 6.2 Canceled Tickets

A canceled or voided ticket is a document that has been issued, but, for a variety of reasons, the issuer has decided to cancel the document. The Transaction Code (TRNC) in Record 1 contains either ‘CANR’ or ‘CANX.’ CANX is generally used if the document is voided within the same business cycle (from the system provider cutoff period to the next day cutoff period) as the sale. CANR is generally used for documents voided outside the same business cycle as the sale. All the initial sales information is known about the voided document, so that information should be passed into the ATPCO Sales Data Exchange in case the recipient cannot match the void to the original. All available data should be provided. In the example below, Record 1 is mandatory and all other records would be optional depending on the availability of the data.

A CANX transaction can be received within the same file as the sale record, and also can be received on a different day from the sale.

--- Chunk 48 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
A CANX transaction can be received within the same file as the sale record, and also can be received on a different day from the sale.

Scenario Sale Cancellation 1 Transmitted IN as TKTT Transmitted IN as CANX 1000EST 19 February 2008 1000 EST 19 February 2008 Transmitted OUT Transmitted OUT 19 February 2008 19 February 2008 2 Transmitted IN as TKTT Transmitted in as CANR 1100 EST 19 February 2008 1100 EST 20 February 2008 Transmitted OUT Transmitted OUT 19 February 2008 20 February 2008

Only Worldspan (5235) and Amadeus (7906) produce CANR transactions. All other system providers show canceled records as CANX.

Worldspan currently sends the same number of Record 1 VOIDs as the number of distinct tickets in the original transaction. Therefore, for a three-ticket conjunction, Worldspan (5235) sends three Record 1s for the cancellation, with the CNJ on the second and third CANX/CANR Record 1s. All other system providers only send a single Record 1 for a cancellation.

The ISR process for matching and merging a sales transaction to its respective cancel transaction can be found in Section 5.4.3.

ISR customers should note that the ISR process attempts to merge and match sales and cancels with the same ticket number (TDNR) and agency code (AGTN), and will only output one transaction with indictors to show that the sale has been canceled.

As well as processing TCN from ticketing systems, student organizations also send data into the exchange for onward transmission to recipients. It should be noted that because of different business conditions applied to the sale of student tickets, there are certain exceptions relating to mandatory records and elements with this data, including but not limited to,

• A Form of Payment Record (Record 7) may not be provided.

In many cases, a fare (FARE/FNUM/EQFR/EQEFN) is not provided. This is related to the fact that many Student fares are encoded in the Fare Basis Ticket Designator (FBTD) field, and are interpreted by the carrier receiving the data.

Section 8 Record and Element Construction Rules

Section 8.1 Conjunction Tickets

Conjunction tickets can be determined by a number greater than ‘01’ in Conjunction—Total Tickets (CTOT) and the presence of a Ticket Number in the Conjunction—Prime Ticket Number (CPTK) element. Note: The Prime Ticket of a Conjuncted Ticket Set does not have ‘CNJ’ in the Conjunction Ticket Indicator (CJCP). The second and succeeding Tickets of the Conjuncted Ticket Set has ‘CNJ’ in the Conjunction Ticket Indicator (CUCP).

Conjunction transactions are indicated by a CTOT greater than ‘01’ and equal to the number of tickets in the conjuncted set (for example, for a four-ticket conjunction, CTOT = 04). The tickets within the transaction set must be sequenced in order, always starting with CREL = 01 and incrementing by one unit, ending with CREL = CTOT.

The general format of Conjunction Tickets is shown in Section 6.3.

Relating the different tickets of a conjuncted ticket set together is accomplished by the following methods:

1. All the tickets forming a Conjuncted Ticket Set have the same Ticket Number in the Conjunction—Prime Ticket Number (CPTK).

--- Chunk 127 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
1. All the tickets forming a Conjuncted Ticket Set have the same Ticket Number in the Conjunction—Prime Ticket Number (CPTK).

2. All tickets of a Conjuncted Ticket Set have the same number in the Conjunction—Total Tickets (CTOT), and that number will be greater than ‘01.’ The Prime Ticket has ‘01’ in the Conjunction— Relative Ticket (CREL). The Second Ticket of a Conjunction Ticket Set has ‘02’ in the Conjunction—Relative Ticket (CREL). Succeeding Tickets increase by increments of one in the Conjunction—Relative Ticket (CREL) until the last Ticket is equal to Conjunction—Total Tickets (CTOT).

The Transmission Control Number (TCNR) for a Conjuncted Ticket Set may be handled in two different ways:

1. The System Provider may use the same TCNR throughout the Conjuncted Ticket Set (with the TDNR incrementing by one for each new ticket in the set).

2. The System Provider may increment the TDNR by one for each new ticket in the Conjuncted Ticket Set (with the TDNR also incrementing by one for each new ticket in the set).

Section 8.2 Use of Coupon Blocks in Itinerary and Proration Records

The Itinerary Record (05); the Proration, ISC, and Tax Records (6, 97, and 98); and the Coupon Related Information Record (81) each contain four repeatable coupon blocks of data. Under traditional ticketing practices, each of the coupon blocks represents a coupon and a single flight. Carrier/GDS programs should be developed to read/write coupon blocks until the Coupon Number (COUN) with a blank is encountered. A blank Coupon Number (COUN) indicates that there are no more coupons to be processed.

traditional four-coupon ticket has four coupon blocks. Top or bottom voiding can be determined by examining the Coupon Number (COUN) of each coupon block or by examining the Coupon Use Indicator (CPUI) in Record 1—Base Sale Record.

The Record 98 (Interlineable Tax Record) is repeatable to accommodate more than four tax occurrences on each coupon block.

Section 8.3 Voiding

--- Chunk 130 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
The Record 98 (Interlineable Tax Record) is repeatable to accommodate more than four tax occurrences on each coupon block.

ACHEO

Section 8.3 Voiding

Various methods of voiding are provided according to the sales market in which the ticket is issued (policy determined at a country level). However, the recommended method of showing voids is the following:

1. All coupons are shown in their relative positions (see below); in other words, for a top-voided ticket, coupon 1 contains a ‘1’ in COUN, with the text ‘VOID’ populated in any of the following elements: ORAC, DSTC, OFTN, MFTN, or FBTD. The first ‘Flown’ coupon (which should be validated against the CPUI) shows the coupon number and the flight details. Coupon numbers must be populated as follows if they have Flown coupons following them in the transaction (single ticket or conjunctive set):

a. COUN = ‘1’ in position 43 Record 5

b. COUN = ‘2’ in position 132 Record 5

c. COUN = ‘3’ in position 221 Record 5

d. COUN = ‘4’ in position 310 Record 5

--- Chunk 131 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
a. COUN = ‘1’ in position 43 Record 5

b. COUN = ‘2’ in position 132 Record 5

c. COUN = ‘3’ in position 221 Record 5

d. COUN = ‘4’ in position 310 Record 5

Note that conjunctive tickets behave in exactly the same manner; in other words, if the second or subsequent ticket in a conjunctive set contains a top void, any void coupons contain the coupon number and the text ‘VOID’ as described above

The only exception to the above is when the transaction (that is, the last ticket of the set) has no remaining flight coupons. The last flight coupon is placed in its relative position as above, and any remaining coupon numbers and coupon details are blank. This is referred to as a “bottom void” transaction.

Note that in most cases, the true Operating Flight Number (OFTN) is not known and will not be available in the TCN record unless the marketing carrier has specifically instructed this information.

ACHEO

Section 8.5 Codeshare Processing

ATPCO’s Sales Data Exchange (SDE) codeshare process previously used carrier-supplied codeshare ranges to generate our transactions. Based on requests from participants, ATPCO enhanced this process to create codeshare transactions from OAG Schedules Data (World Data File [WDF]) each week. The same information used to create your OAG Schedules is now used to generate codeshare transactions for your interline partners, eliminating the need for you to instruct ATPCO directly of all codeshare ranges.

Participants can provide exceptions to the OAG Schedules Data, including any overrides or off-cycle information, by manually submitting instructions to ATPCO.

ATPCO also augments transactions based on the OAG Schedules Data or carrier override information with flight-specific information.

--- Chunk 138 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
ATPCO also augments transactions based on the OAG Schedules Data or carrier override information with flight-specific information.

The new data elements in SDE Record 5 use existing filler fields, so you will not be affected if you are not yet ready to use this data. All other new data fields are included in a new record, Record 85. This will allow you to implement these new data elements into your system when you are ready to do so.

Example of the ATPCO Codeshare Service

ATPCO uses codeshare functionality to generate copies of sales data transactions for participants even if the data provider (for example, global distribution systems) did not address the transaction to the participant. Both the data provider and the marketing carrier drive this distribution and allow or disallow the generation of transaction copies.

--- Chunk 139 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Carrier XX enters a codeshare arrangement that marketed flight XX1234 is operated by ZZ5678. Carrier XX is a participant in the ATPCO SDE codeshare service and so is Carrier ZZ. Any sales data transaction that includes MCAR and MFTN of XX and 1234 is copied for ZZ as the operator. All sales transactions (both the XX and ZZ copies) are augmented with value-added schedules information at a coupon level.

If either XX or ZZ does not participate in the Sales Data Exchange, then a copy cannot be generated. To offer the above service, ATPCO will perform the following steps.

Database Load

The OAG Weekly WDF file is loaded every Sunday morning. This file represents the most current schedules information available at that time. This table will be replaced in its entirety with each load.

Marketing carriers can override the OAG information by supplying codeshare instructions to ATPCO. They can also choose to continue to allow the operating carriers to provide this override information.

Matching Criteria

--- Chunk 140 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Matching Criteria

The incoming Sales Data Transaction is matched against data in ATPCO’s Sales Data Exchange Schedules Data (an explanation of population of data is provided below). If a match is made based on Marketing Carrier, Marketing Flight Number, Geography (if applicable), and Day of Week (if applicable), a copy of that record is made for the operating carrier and the transaction is augmented to include the value-added schedules data that is available within the OAG data.

Transaction Generation

A copy of the sales data transaction is made for the operating carrier.

On the copied version to the codeshare partner, the ATPCO system populates the Operating Carrier (OCAR) and Operating Flight Number Fields (OFTN) on the transaction with the operating carrier's two-letter code and flight number. ATPCO overwrites the Operating Carrier in all instances based on information filed in ATPCO Schedules Data, supplied either by OAG or carrier override data.

b. On the original version, Operating Carrier (OCAR) and Operating Flight Number Fields (OFTN) on the SDE transaction are populated with the operating carrier’s two-letter code and flight

number. ATPCO overwrites the Operating Carrier in all instances based on the information filed in ATPCO Schedules Data.

c. The ATPCO Codeshare Indicator (ATCS) field, Byte 373 on Record 1, contains one of the following values:

Blank = Original ISR/TCN record that has not been shared by ATPCO.

1= Original ISR/TCN record that has been shared.

2= Copy of an ISR/TCN record that has been generated by ATPCO’s codeshare process.

Section 8.6 Refund File Structure

A refund transaction requires a minimum of three records: Record 1, Record 4, and Record 7. For conjunction tickets, Record 1 is repeated until all refund coupons have been reported (see the following Refund Transaction File Structure diagram). Many of the data elements required for a ticket sale are not required for a refund transaction. Note the optional data elements in the following refund records.

Repeat Record 1 for conjunction tickets. Use as many Record 1s as required to report all refunded coupons. Record 1 Ne Record1 Record 1 Base Sale Record |<" Base Sale Record Base Sale Record (Conjunction “ (Conjunction ‘ Ticket) > Ticket) Record 4 Financial Record Record 7 Form of Payment Record

Figure 8-B: Refund Transaction File Structure

--- Chunk 143 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Figure 8-B: Refund Transaction File Structure

Because ISR/TCN data is unsigned, data recipients can assume that a reversal transaction such as a refund has the opposite sign to a normal ticket sale; in other words, the fare is negative (paid back to the customer), commission is positive (paid back to the airline), and tax is negative (paid back to the customer).

Section 8.11 Supplier Treatment of Repeated Records

As described in Section 5, a number of records can be repeated. Certain of these—the Record 7 (Form of Payment Record), Record 9 (Exchanged Document Information Record), and the Structured Fare Calculation Records (80, 81, 82)—are used to provide completely independent information in the second occurrence.

--- Chunk 144 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
The Record 4 (Financial Record) is slightly different in that there are redundant elements in the second occurrence. For example, a ticket with 12 taxes uses all of the nine tax elements in the first Record 4, and the first three tax positions in the second Record 4. But because the ticket is the same, the FNUM (for example) is redundant the second time around. The chart below lists major suppliers and whether the elements in the second occurrence of the Record 4 are blank or repeated from the first occurrence:

Structured Fare Calculation Records provide detail on the pricing of the fare components included in the reported sales transaction. In order to benefit downline processing (for example, Revenue Accounting), the information is provided (subject to GDS population of the records and data elements) at four different levels:

Section 8.13 Reporting Standards for Ticketing Fees

Ticketin ig Fees as priced by the ATPCO subscription pricing record S4 represent fees collected at the ticket level that are to be retained by the Validating Carrier. An example is a charge to the passenger for the use of a credit card.

These fees are charged at the ticket level, so they will be reported under the following conventions:

--- Chunk 146 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
These fees are charged at the ticket level, so they will be reported under the following conventions:

1. Fees reported under tax code (TMFT) of OB representing the IATA standard code for Validating Carrier fees will be reported in the Record 4 (Financial Amounts Record).

As such, OB fee amounts and codes (TMFA/TMFT) will follow any government Taxes, Fees, and Charges reported on the same ticket (that is, they will appear last).

The Fee Sub Code that uniquely identifies the fee which has been applied (pricing record S4) will be shown in the TMFT field immediately following the OB code.

The only exception to rule 2 is when a government Tax, Fee, or Charge is due on the Ticketing Fee. In this case the Tax, Fee, or Charge levied on the fee will be reported directly following the fee to which it applies. In addition, certain countries may have legislation which dictate that all taxes under a particular code must be grouped together, in which case ordering will be dictated by these rules (for example when the same tax is applied to the ticket and to the fee).

--- Chunk 147 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
As a general rule, the FPAM (Form of Payment Amount) and the TDAM (Ticket Document Amount) will equal the sum of the fare, Taxes/Fees/Charges, and any ticketing fee applied to the transaction. For exchange/reissue transactions, the FPAM and the TDAM will be equal to the additional amounts paid with the new transaction.

An example of the reporting of a ticketing fee is shown below:

Fare USD 3435.00 Tax USD 13.00 Fee 1 (0B123) USD 5.00 Fee 2 (OB456) USD 10.00 Tax on Fee 2 USD 5.00 Fee 3 (OB789) USD 15.00 Ticket Document Amount USD 3483.00

Section 9.1 Codeshare Functionality

Refer to Section 8.4 for the business logic driving the ATPCO codeshare process.

Section 9.1.1 Record Identification

1. The incoming record is identified for the sender and receiver of data.

2. Permission must be received from the marketing carrier of a flight coupon of the original data and the marketing carrier must have an agreement from the sender to pass the data on toa codeshare partner or a third party.

3. The marketing carrier may authorize the operating carrier to instruct the actual flight number ranges on their behalf (that is, the operating carrier advises flight range to ATPCO).

Unless the operating carrier has previously sent an instruction to ATPCO (stating that the operating carrier will not receive codeshare data), ATPCO assumes that any carrier in the addressing envelope has the authority to send codeshare data as filed.

If BA has sent an instruction (that is, BA does not wish to receive the data from this codeshare range), then BA will not receive coupon 1.

Section 9.1.2 Matching Criteria

The incoming TCN is matched against data coded in ATPCO’s TCN codeshare tables. If a match is made, based on Marketing Carrier, Marketing Flight Number, Geography (if applicable), Day of Week (if applicable) and Time of Day (if applicable), a copy of that record is made for the operating carrier.

The marketing carrier must be a participant in the Sales Data Exchange to participate in the codeshare service.

Example Use of the Codeshare Service

Carrier XX enters into a codeshare arrangement that marketed flight XX1234 is operated by ZZ5678. Carrier XX is a participant in the codeshare service and so is Carrier ZZ. Carrier XX instructs ATPCO to add the above flights to codeshare tables. Any TCN including MCAR and MFTN of XX and 1234 is copied for override ZZ as the operator.

--- Chunk 150 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
ZZ can also advise ATPCO of this arrangement providing they have the authority from XX to do so.

If XX or ZZ do not participate in the TCN exchange, this codeshare agreement cannot be filed with ATPCO.

ACHEO

Section 9.1.3 Processing the TCN

1. A copy of the TCN/ISR is made for the operating carrier.

2. On the copied version to the codeshare partner, populate the Operating Carrier (OCAR) and Operating Flight Number Fields (OFTN) on the TCN with the operating carrier's two-letter code and flight number. ATPCO overwrites the Operating Carrier in all instances based on information filed in ATPCO Codeshare Tables. Note that for ISR, the Operating Carrier and the Operating Flight Number are populated on both copies (original and codeshare copy) of the sales record.

3. The ATCS field, Byte 373 on Record 1, contains one of the following values:

Blank = Original ISR/TCN record that has not been codeshared by ATPCO.

= Original ISR/TCN record that has been codeshared.

= Copy of an ISR/TCN record that has been generated by ATPCO’s codeshare process.

Section 9.1.4 Reporting

--- Chunk 151 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
= Original ISR/TCN record that has been codeshared.

= Copy of an ISR/TCN record that has been generated by ATPCO’s codeshare process.

Section 9.1.4 Reporting

ATPCO provides a report to the System Provider and original receiver (Marketing Carrier) of the number of TCNs that were codeshared to an Operating Carrier partner. This report lists who the original marketing carrier was on the TCN and the operating carrier to whom the TCN was sent.

Section 9.2 Central Addressing

The Central Addressing function ensures that all marketing airlines in the itinerary of the transaction receive the transaction, even if the data provider did not specify the airline as a recipient.

Central Addressing cannot identify a company other than the airlines on the ticket (for example, credit card companies). ATPCO requests that GDSs and ticketing systems continue to specify these other companies as recipients of the data.

Section 9.3 Sales Data Exchange Plus

--- Chunk 152 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Section 9.3 Sales Data Exchange Plus

Sales Data Exchange Plus uses daily Sales Data Exchange feeds to determine the applicable taxes for the transaction, on the sale, any departure, and any arrival. The data is allocated to the coupon level for the purposes of easy accounting, interline billing and settlement, and remittance. This industry solution for tax calculation and reporting saves Sales Data Exchange Plus customers time and labor, and breaks down taxes to the required level of detail instead of simply reporting them at the ticket level.

Benefits include easy identification of taxes that have been undercollected by travel agencies, a cost saving by providing needed data content for revenue accounting and sales audit systems, and easier reconciliation of taxes to their appropriate tax points to avoid expensive write-offs from the balance sheet.

Section 9.4 Net Remit Data Removal

--- Chunk 153 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Section 9.4 Net Remit Data Removal

Net remit data removal is a central process that enables the removal of sensitive information from tickets that are addressed to participants other than the ticket Validating Carrier. Exceptions can be instructed by the Validating Carrier where such information needs to be shared with an interline partner, and as such, these can be coded by

The following fields are stripped from all ISRs/TCNs that are to be sent to a participant other than the validating carrier (subject to exceptions coded as described above).

Field Description AEBA Amount Entered by Agent APBC Amount Paid by Customer COAM Commission Amount CORT Commission Rate COTP Commission Type FPAM Form of Payment Amount EFRT Effective Commission Rate EFCO Effective Commission Amount NTFA Net Fare Amount REMT Remittance Amount SPAM Supplementary Amount SPTP Supplementary Type SPRT Supplementary Rate

--- Chunk 154 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
When these elements are stripped from an ISR/TCN, they are replaced with filler. Any alphanumeric field (A/N) is filled with blanks and any numeric field (N) is filled with nines. For example if the COAM (an 11byte N) field is stripped, the space remaining is replaced with 99999999999. Another example is the COTP field (6-byte A/N). If this field were to be stripped, the six bytes would be filled with spaces. No changes will be made to any of the above fields if the field is already unoccupied before the net remit removal process.

An ISR participant can submit a Net Remit form to ATPCO stating that for any ISR where they are the validating carrier, they wish to allow the above fields, or any combination of these, to be sent to another specified (non-validating) carrier or carriers. Subscriber Net Remit forms must be submitted to ATPCO via ServiceManager. If you do not wish to submit a Net Remit form, all fields stated above will be stripped from all ISRs where you are the validating carrier for all participants, except in the validating carrier's ISR/TCN file.

Sales Data file filtering allows subscribers to include or exclude transactions from the output ISR file based on specified parameters. This offers the flexibility of carrier-specific filtering on the following fields:

The most common use of this feature today is for carriers to filter out the BSP sales they have sent to ATPCO from being sent back to them in the outbound file from ATPCO (note that the BSP is addressed back to the validating carrier as part of the standard process). In order to achieve this simple filter, an airline would code the following:

Include ALL

Section 9.8 Billing Value Determination

The Billing Value Determination process exists for signatories to the AIA Services contract. When a carrier “uses” or “lifts” another carrier's ticket in an unplanned environment and does not have the requisite sales data for that ticket, a request file (Record 50) is sent to ATPCO via the Simplified Interline Settlement to retrieve the complete original sale record, which is dispatched to the NFP process to generate proration results for the coupons requested in the Record 50.

Section 9.9 Integration of Canceled Transactions into Associated Sale (ISR)

When a positive match is found, the records are merged, using an indicator in the Record 1 (RTYP) to indicate the type of reversal included with the sale. Other elements that can change between the sale and the cancellation—namely, TCN number (TCNR), TCN check digit (TCND), Passenger Name Record (PNRR), Date of Issue (DAIS), and Electronic Settlement Authorization Code (ESAC)—will be populated on the Record 2 as reversal data elements (RTCN, RTND, RTNR, RTIS, and RTAC).

--- Chunk 162 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
Carriers using the AIA services may then apply the Sales Data Filter (see Section 9.3) to specifically exclude from proration sales transactions that have subsequently been canceled, based on the data foundation (FNDT).

Further information on reporting of canceled tickets can be found in Section 6.2.

Section 9.10.2 FNUM/EQEN Derivation for BSP-only ISR

BSP files do not support FNUM, CUTP, EQFN, or CUTP for passing on to the Record 4 in the case of a BSP-only ISR because these are TCN-only fields. ATPCO will enhance the Record 4 in these cases by deriving the FNUM and the EQFN with associated currency types from the FARE and EQFR fields within the record. The exception to this rule is where there is no derivable value in the FARE and EQFR fields (such as BULK, IT, or blank). In this case, the COBL and associated CUTP will be used to populate either the EQFN/CUTP fields (where EQFR has a non-blank entry), or the FNUM/CUTP fields (where EQFR has a blank entry).

Section 9.11 Credit Card BIN Processing

ATPCO offers functionality to credit card companies to filter the TCN/ISR records sent by Credit Card BIN (the Bank Identification Number, which is the first six digits of the credit card number). These BINs are held in a table by credit card vendor. Suppliers may send all transactions to a credit card company, and the ATPCO BIN process will filter out any transactions which are not relevant to that subscriber.

Section 9.12 File Copy

Outbound files can be copied and sent to a third-party processor for a copy fee. The subscriber requesting the file copy must obtain the permission of Sabre, Worldspan, Galileo, and Amadeus before ATPCO can implement this change.

Section 9.13 Duplicate Ticket Removal

In the TCN process, when a duplicate ticket is found based on the TDNR, the TRNC, and the PXNM in the same file, the duplicate is removed from the file and processing of that transaction ceases. Duplicate checking across files is not available in TCN.

--- Chunk 165 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
In the ISR process, duplicate checking occurs across files for as long as the TCN is stored before it is sent to the recipient. Duplicates are identified by elements TDNR, TRNC, and AGTN. When duplicates are identified, the second ticket is dropped and the processing of that transaction ceases. Certain key data fields from TCN-to-TCN duplicates are held in a table for analysis as required

Section 9.14 Conjunction Handling

Conjunction tickets are controlled by TCN number along with the ticket number, ensuring that data is sorted back in the correct sequence. In the case of the ISR, BSP-only data is enhanced to provide additional data elements that tie the transaction together.

Section 9.15 Backup Recovery

Inbound files to ATPCO are stored for 7 days, so that data is not lost because of any errors occurring during processing. The file is re-run and the TCN process re-started.

Glossary Element Description Attribute Reference AGTN Agency Numeric Code 8 Alphanumeric Record Status Facsimile Example Cross-Edit | Starting Position 1 M N 46101101 Y 166

This element has an attribute of alphanumeric because Airline Location Number (ALON) populates the same physical location in Record 1 when a ticket is sold at a company location. Some carriers have assigned alpha characters to their Airline Location Number (ALON). When Agency Numeric Code (AGTN) is used for agencies, it is numeric and standard modulus 7 check digit routines can calculate the check digit.

A numeric code that is assigned to each Approved Location where an agency is authorized to issue Standard Traffic Documents (STDs) on behalf of ticketing airlines and that is imprinted on each validly issued STD.

This field should be populated with the numeric code of the agency physically carrying out the ticket issuance transaction to the passenger. Note that although coupons can be printed elsewhere (for example, STP locations), the AGTN is always the agency controlling the audit coupon of the ticket. For IATA transactions, this is also the agency settling the transaction with the validating carrier.

--- Chunk 180 from aptco_big_dc.pdf ---
In the United States, the number is defined as a two-digit state code, followed by a five-digit agency number, followed by a modulus-7 check digit.

This element is used in Net Reporting Method 2A. This is the circumstance when the agency collects an amount from the customer credit card that exceeds the net fare amount as filed in ATPCO Category 35 but is less than the published fare. The value is the amount actually paid by the customer to the agency, including taxes. When the data owner chooses to inhibit distribution of this data, ATPCO will, as part of the net remit data removal process, populate this element with all nines (9). If the element is suppressed by the system provider, it will be populated with zeros (0).

One use of this element is to calculate the tax liability on the amount earned by the agency.

A negotiated fare is a fare that is not publicly displayed and distributed, but is offered selectively to customers and agencies; differs from any published fare in level, conditions, or reservation booking designator; or where the commission paid to an agency differs from the standard commission.

The check digit routine is a device used to improve the accuracy of data input of a series of numbers. Modulus-7 check digit routine is used for Standard Traffic Document (STD) Ticket Numbers and Transaction Control Numbers (TCN). It is calculated by dividing the numbered series unweighted by seven and declaring the remainder to be the check digit (modulus-7).

Pre-numbered STDs (OPTATs) have a check digit based on Coupon Number followed by Form and Serial Number (omitting Carrier Code), in the format C FFF SSSSSSS D, where C is coupon number, FFF is the STD form number, SSSSSSS is the STD serial number, and D is the check digit. For auditor's coupons, the coupon number is assumed to be zero.

Cat! Eligibility

CAT1 ELIGIBILITY

Category 1 (Eligibility) provides the capability to further define the passenger for whom the fare applies.

Category 1 is a supplement to the Fare Class Application further defining the passenger. If a passenger type codes does not have additional eligibility requirements, then it should be coded in the Fare Class Application only and not repeated in Category 1.

How to Link Eligibility and Security Data

Option 1 Category 15 IF Category 1

Option 1 uses Category 1 as a qualifying condition to control to who can sell the fare. Coding Category 15 (Sales Restrictions) as a main provision allows the Travelport 360 Fares system to sell the fare to anyone who is eligible to use the fare. Listing the 1V/1G/1P CRS code in the main Category 15 and linking to the qualifying IF Category 1 controls to whom the fare can be sold. Once a passenger is identified in the IF Category 1, then only the CRS/GDS listed in the associated Category 15 portion can sell to the specified passenger.

Example 1

Data

THEN Category 15 (1V)

IF Category 1 (JCB)

THEN Category 15 (1G)

IF Category 1 (PFA)

THEN Category 15 (1G)

IF Category 1 (PFA)

IF Category 1 (PFS)|

Results

Only 1V can sell to the JCB passenger, only 1G can sell to the PFA passenger, and only 1P can sell to the PFS passenger. Category 15 controls who can sell the fare and the IF Category 1 controls to whom the fare can be sold.

Example 2

THEN Category 15 (CRS 1V; PCC 123)

OR Category 15 (CRS 1G; PCC 456)

Results

Both 1V pseudo city 123 and 1G pseudo city 456 can sell to the JCB passenger using account code ABC. Only 1V pseudo city 789 can sall to the PFA passenger using account code DEF, and only 1P pseudo city 012 can sell to the PFA passenger using account code GHI. Category 15 controls who can sell the fare and the IF Category 1 controls to whom the fare can be sold.

Option 2 Category 35 IF Category 1

--- Chunk 437 from Cat1 - Eligibility.pdf ---
Option 2 Category 35 IF Category 1

Option 2 uses Category 1 as a qualifying condition to control to whom can sell the fare. Coding Category 35 (Negotiated Fares) as a main provision allows the Travelport 360 Fares system to sell the fare to anyone who is eligible to use the fare. Unlike Category 15, Category 35 includes a passenger type field. When the information within multiple data tables applies to different

https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/FaresAndPricing/Content/Cat1 Eligibility.Atm

Cat! Eligibility

passenger type codes, it can be coded within the Category 35 without having to IF to a Category 1. However, if there is a need to indicate that the different data tables within the same sequence are applicable to different account codes or other eligibility information, then an IF Category 1 is needed. Listing the 1V/1G/1P CRS code in the main Category 35 and linking to the qualifying IF Category 1 controls to whom the fare can be sold. Once a passenger is identified in the IF Category 1, then only the CRS/GDS listed in the associated Category 15 portion can sell to the specified passenger.

Only 1V can sell to the JCB passenger, only 1G can sell to the PFA passenger, and only 1P can sell to the PFS passenger. Category 35 controls who can sell the fare and the IF Category 1 controls to whom the fare can be sold.

1V is not able to sell to the PFA or PFS passenger, 1G is not able to sell to the JCB or PFS passenger, and 1P is not able to sell to the JCB or PFA passenger. Category 35 controls who can sell the fare and to whom.

THEN Category 35 PTC JCB (1V PCC 123; 1G pec 456)

IF Category 1 PTC JCB Account code ABC

IF Category 1 PTC PFA Account code DEF

THEN Category 35 PTC PFS (1P PCC 012)

IF Category 1 PTC PFS Account code GHI

Results

Both 1V pseudo city 123 and 1G pseudo city 456 can sell to the JCB passenger using account code ABC. They are not able to sell to the PFA passenger using account code DEF, or the PFS passenger using account code GHI.

--- Chunk 439 from Cat1 - Eligibility.pdf ---
Both 1V pseudo city 123 and 1G pseudo city 456 can sell to the JCB passenger using account code ABC. They are not able to sell to the PFA passenger using account code DEF, or the PFS passenger using account code GHI.

Only 1V pseudo city 789 can sell to the PFA passenger using account code DEF. This user is not able to sell to the JCB passenger using account code ABC, or the PFS passenger using account code GHI.

Only 1P pseudo city 012 can sell to the PFS passenger using account code GHI. This user is not able to sell to the JCB passenger using account code ABC, or the PFA passenger using account code DEF.

Category 35 controls who can sell the fare and the IF Category 1 controls to whom the fare can be sold.

A Passenger type of Adult “ADT” in Category 1 does not match ALL passenger types; it only matches ADT. Therefore, when Category 35 is filed with an IF to Category 1 for a passenger type and, if applicable, account code and other associated PTCs (i.e. CNN, INF) are also eligible for the fare, the string must contain an OR Category 1 for each passenger type.

--- Chunk 440 from Cat1 - Eligibility.pdf ---
An OR CAT01 is needed for all the primary passenger types in Record 1/Record 8/Category 25 and the secondary passenger type found in Categories 19-22 that are eligible for the private fare.

Example

THEN CATEGORY 35 PTC BLANK DT CCOUNT CNN; ACCOUNT INF; ACCOUNT INS; ACCOUNT UNN; ACCOUNT

Option 3 Category 1 IF Category 15

Option 3 uses Category 15 as the qualifying condition to control when the eligibility provision appliers. This option does not apply to Category 35 as Category 35 cannot be used as a qualifying category. This option does not control the passenger type to whom the system can sell the fare. This option is used when the eligibility provisions is dependent upon the sales restriction provision.

CAT10 COMBINATIONS

Travelport 360 Fares is complaint with ATPCO Data application and IATA Resolution 017b for Cat10. Travelport do not maintain any Cat10 tables to manage combinations.

As per the IATA Resolution Advisory Working Group (RADWG) combinations template it is the responsibility of the Airline to control Cat10

IATA QUOTE

RADWG Members,

The 2014 Composite meeting agreed, for effective 1 October 2015, to make the Normal Fare Open Jaw less restrictive to allow Origin Open Jaw in different countries. As the change to the normal fare open jaw processing results in making the process the same for both normal fares and special fares, definitions were combined for simplicity and Resolution 017b adjusted accordingly.

It was recognized that the agreed changes will have significant impact on pricing process; however, there are controls in place if the fares are appropriately coded, for example the combination category (cat. 10). To support airlines that need to review their coding to ensure that their fares are auto-priced as intended, a RADWG taskforce lead by ATPCO developed a template as attached that airlines can reference when coding their fares

--- Chunk 444 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
The IATA Document shows examples and has a lot of detail. To view the IATA RADWG document in full click here

Combinations (Category 10) provides automated functionality for carriers to express whether or not their fares are permitted to combine to form specific combination types and any restrictions applicable to those combinations. Combination restrictions are expressed through the use of eight sub-ordinate Record 3s, known as Sub-categories. The Sub-categories are identified as Major or Minor Sub-categories

Major Sub-categories Minor Sub-categories Title Carrer Combinations | TarifffRule Combinations 102 | Round Trips 103 | Circle Trips | Fare Class/Fare Type Combinations Open Jaw Sets

Combination definitions, assumptions, and applications do not differ for Normal or Special fares.

Open Jaws

Travelport 360 Fares allows carriers to control combinations and the creation of open jaw pricing units based on their Category 10 data, as hard-coded restrictions do not allow for flexibility for carriers that want all options available for combinations.

* Number of fare components (see NOTE)

* Combination of domestic and international fare components

If the intent is to restrict the open jaw to two international fare components, then this can be controlled via the automated data but is not controlled by Travelport

NOTE: While ATPCO data assumes there is no limit on the number of fare components, most systems will not price an Open Jaw with more than two fare components.

Once Open Jaws are permitted, the assumption is that they are permitted with no restrictions (e.g. there is no mileage restriction) unless otherwise specified. If the intent is to restrict the mileage on the open segment of an open jaw, then this can be controlled via the automated data solution as defined on the following page.

Assumptions

No Applicable Category 10 data

When Category 10 data is not present or processing cannot resolve to applicable Category 10 data, the system assumption is that Open Jaws, Round Trips, Circle Trips, and End-on-End combinations are not permitted. Mirror Image combinations are permitted.

Below are the assumptions for each major sub-category:

« Sub-category 101 Open Jaws: Open Jaw combinations are not permitted.

• Sub-category 102 Round Trips: Round Trip combinations are not permitted.

• Mirror Image combinations are permitted.

• Sub-category 103 Circle Trips: Circle Trip combinations are not permitted.

« Sub-category 104 End-on-End: End-on-End combinations are not permitted.

Applicable Category 10 data

--- Chunk 452 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
• Sub-category 103 Circle Trips: Circle Trip combinations are not permitted.

« Sub-category 104 End-on-End: End-on-End combinations are not permitted.

Applicable Category 10 data

Once processing resolves to applicable Category 10 data, the Scoreboard will specify whether a combination type is permitted, not permitted, permitted with restrictions (or required, in the case of End on End). If a combination type is permitted, then it is assumed to be permitted with no restrictions unless otherwise specified by data elements in the Scoreboard, major sub-category, and/or minor sub-category.

When data is present for one of the major sub-categories, data may also be present for any/all of the minor sub-categories specifying restrictions applicable to the major sub-category. However, a minor sub-category does not have to be present.

The absence of a minor sub-category invokes the following system assumptions:

« Sub-category 106: Combinations permitted with fares of any carrier and any geography

Sub-category 107: Combinations permitted with fares governed by any public or private tariff and any rule

Sub-category 108: Combinations permitted with any round trip or one way fare

Restricting End-on-End Pricing

--- Chunk 455 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
When determining the best possible pricing solution for itineraries or portions of itineraries that qualify as an open jaw with at least one special fare included in the mix, Travelport 360 Fares will consider two possible pricing solutions; an open jaw pricing unit, or two one way end-on-end pricing units. Both options will be considered a valid combination for pricing if Category 10 validation passes for all rules in the combination. Carriers should file end-on-end combination restrictions for their special fares one way fares if they don’t want them quoting in these situations. This can be done by restricting the geography allowed for the end-on-end combinations or by restricting end-on combinations to specific tariffs and/or rules. Additionally, open jaw restrictions filed in the Category 10 Record 2 scoreboard can restrict a fare from being used in a one way end-on-end combination. Specific values in the Category 10 Record 2 scoreboard can further control fare combinations and restrict a one way fare that can also be used as half round trip fares (Tag 1) from being used as a one way pricing unit end-on-end when the open jaw pricing unit for the same fare passes validation.

--- Chunk 456 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
In the Category 10 Record 2 scoreboard for Category 101 (open jaws), “when the Single Open Jaw’ field (byte 95) has values S, T, W, or X, the fare being validated may only be returned in an open jaw pricing solution if the itinerary or fares being priced pass the open jaw combination.

Restricting Public Fare and Private Fare Combinations

--- Chunk 457 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
Restricting Public Fare and Private Fare Combinations

Category 10 Combinations is used to control the type of fares that can be issued on a single ticket. With all fares it is imperative that the carrier’s intention regarding what other public and/or private fares may be combined on a ticket be correctly coded in Category 10 Combinations. Travelport do not maintain combinations on an Airlines behalf. Category 10 Combinations includes the flexibility to allow the combination of a fare with “any other fare.” This allows for full-fares to be sold in combination with other fares. It is important to ensure that the restrictions information to be included in Category 10 correctly meets with your intent. In addition, as it is the responsibility of the private fare to state that the fare is not combinable with another carrier’s public fares, Travelport strongly recommends carriers with private data always code plating carrier restrictions. Either Category 15 (Sales Restrictions) “Validity” field (byte 48) or Category 35 (Negotiated Fares) Ticketing field (bytes 98-102) can be coded to ensure that the private fare will not be ticketed on another carrier’s plate or stock.

--- Chunk 458 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
Travelport strongly recommends that for private fares one of these options is always coded when the fare is intended for an Apollo (1V), Galileo (1G), or Worldspan (1P) supported travel agency.

Highest RT (byte 19)

When the Highest RT byte is filed it is reasonable to expect that the Highest return fare will be charged when combining two fares.

However if you see that this is not working as expected then you can check the below items.

One thing to check is that there is no CAT35 fare in involved.

OPEN JAWS

FARES MAY BE COMBINED ON A HALF ROUND TRIP BASIS

-TO FORM SINGLE OPEN JAWS AT THE POINT OF DESTINATION.

CHARGE THE HIGHEST ROUND-TRIP FARE ON THE OPEN JAW.

Here are the ATPCO data apps

4.1.5 Highest RT (byte 19)

This field specifies that the highest round trip fare of all fare components in the Open Jaw must be charged for the entire Open Jaw. Following is an explanation of applicable values:

Value X: Apply the highest round trip fare. Value X is only applicable when all of the following are true:

¢ All fare components on the pricing unit resolve to an applicable Sub-category 101 Record 3 with Highest RT (byte 19) value X.

¢ All fare components are in the same Cabin.

o Cabin determination is based on the fare (fare type code) and not the booked sectors.

o Only 3 cabins are recognized (first, business, and economy). Fares in premium economy are considered to be economy; premium business are business; and premium first are first.

« No fare component on the pricing unit is a Category 35 fare. <=============

--- Chunk 460 from Cat10 - Combinations.pdf ---
« No fare component on the pricing unit is a Category 35 fare. <=============

If one or more of the above are not true, then Value X has no application and processing applies this field as if it contains value Blank. The OJ is still permitted subject to the remainder of the data in the Set (and subject to limitations on combining Category 35 fares on a ticket).

Therefore we process as if it was blank and allow the combination as 1/2RT because the Sub Category 101 Record 3 tables will

Pass combination validation for Open Jaw.

Cat.10 coded with OVERWATER (Byte 36)

Airlines are not always aware of the definition of OVERWATER when filed in the rule.

The example below shows an International Rule (NYC-AMM) filed with the OVERWATER byte 36

NYC-AMM TU-14JAN14 XX NUC 1384.0@ IRTEEUS 16.

Any Open Jaw pricing would fail Cat10. Here is the ATPCO CAT10 data application

4.6.4 Travel Sectors — Overwater (byte 36)

This field specifies whether the carrier’s fare identified by the data in bytes 17-35 must be an Overwater fare. Determination of an Overwater fare is based upon the Overwater definition in the Glossary of Terms, as follows:

¢ The fare must be in the ATPCO Domestic Fare Product; and

* One fare break point must be within the Continental US/Canada and the other fare break point must be outside the Continental US/CA; and

* The fare must contain a sector between the following points:

¢« Between Continental US/CA and Hawaii; or

« Between US/CA/Hawaii/Alaska and Puerto Rico/USVirgin Islands; or

Cat11 Blackouts

CAT11 BLACKOUTS

Assumptions

In the absence of Category 11 (Record 2 for Category 11 did not exist or no Record 3 was applicable), the system assumption for Category 11 Blackout Dates is that the fare is not subject to blackout dates. When the Blackout Dates Category is applicable, the assumption for applying the Blackout Dates restrictions is: the blackout date(s) applies to ‘The date of departure of all flights within the fare component’, and does not apply to any unticketed intermediate departures of a direct flight. The application of blackout dates may be further modified by the presence of a Geo Spec Table (bytes 27-

42), which will control where in the fare component, pricing unit, or journey the blackout restriction will be applied. A pricing unit only TSI or journey only TSI will override the assumption and apply the date restrictions to the pricing unit or journey. An Arrival TSI modifies the departure application to an arrival application. In addition, if validating a fare component with departing date(s) equal

--- Chunk 464 from Cat11 - Blackouts.pdf ---
to the blackout date(s) and the International Connection Waiver (byte 43) is set, validation is forced outside the fare component to determine if the fare component being validated is used in combination with an international fare component (see processing of byte 43 in section 4.1.3 of this document for further details).

Reconciliation between Footnote and Rule Levels

When a blackout restriction is defined both at the fare rule level and general rule level, all blackout date restrictions from both the fare

rule and general rule apply; unless the general rule is negated by Byte 102 on the Record 2.

When a blackout restriction is defined both at the footnote level and at the fare rule level (including general rule), blackout date

restrictions from all levels apply. All blackout restrictions defined in the footnote and fare rule (including general rule) must be

validated; unless further modified with byte 102General Rule Not Applicable at the fare rule level.

Travel Segment Indicators (TSlIs)

--- Chunk 465 from Cat11 - Blackouts.pdf ---
validated; unless further modified with byte 102General Rule Not Applicable at the fare rule level.

Travel Segment Indicators (TSlIs)

Travel Segment Indicators in Category 11 Blackout Dates are entered in the Between/And Geo Spec Tables (bytes 27-42) and are considered ‘match’ criteria. The geography specified by the TSI must be included within the fare component, pricing unit, or journey of the fare component being validated in order to match the Record 3 table. If the geography is not within the fare component/pricing

unit/journey, the data is considered a ‘no-match’ and processing should continue to the next table. If no further Tables or Sets, apply system assumption.

Coding Conventions

« To apply blackout restrictions to the ‘Departure from Fare Origin’ of the pricing unit versus the departure of all flights within the fare component, TSI 01 (Departure from fare origin) is required.

--- Chunk 466 from Cat11 - Blackouts.pdf ---
« To apply blackout restrictions to the ‘Departure from Fare Origin’ of the pricing unit versus the departure of all flights within the fare component, TSI 01 (Departure from fare origin) is required.

¢ To apply blackout restriction to only the ‘Departure of the Originating Flight’ of the fare component versus the departure of all flights within the fare component, TSI 03 (Departure of each trip) or TSI 51 (Departure of each fare component) is required.

« Between/And Geographic Specification Tables should have data in the geographic location fields when both are coded. It is not logical to code them both with only TSls.

How do | code data when surcharges vary for adult, child and infant?

The examples below illustrate best practices for adult, infant, and children fares when their surcharges differ from one another. Please note that each example differs as the intent behind each of the conditions differs.

Example 1

The data in the example illustrates that there is a 0.00 USD surcharge for infant without a seat. All other passenger type codes will have a 20.00 USD surcharge applied; the surcharge amount is not subject to a children/infant discount.

1. If the passenger on the fare component being validated is using passenger type code INF under the age of 2, then a fuel surcharge of 0.00 USD will apply to the fare component.

2. Otherwise, a fuel surcharge of 20.00 USD will apply to the fare component.

Cat13 Accompanied Travel

CAT13 ACCOMPANIED TRAVEL

The Accompanied Travel Category (Category 13) is used when travel with one or more other passengers is necessary to qualify for the fare. It may also include travel restrictions based on the portion(s) of a fare component where travel together is required and/or PTC/fare class/RBD of the accompanying passengers.

passengers.

Although the title of Category 13 is Accompanied Travel, the category is used to express the requirements for the accompanying passenger(s) that must travel with the passenger associated to the fare that resolves to the Category 13 Record 2. Exception, the Maximum Number field (byte 62) is used to indicate when more than one accompanied passenger is permitted on the fare component being validated against the Category 13 Record 2

In order to validate Accompanied Travel (Category 13), it is essential to know:

« Passenger types, ages, and the number of passengers accompanying the passenger on the fare component being validated.

« All ticketed points and the pricing unit for the passenger being validated and for any accompanying passengers.

« Fare class codes and RBDs for any accompanying passengers.

--- Chunk 472 from Cat13 - Accompanied Travel.pdf ---
« All ticketed points and the pricing unit for the passenger being validated and for any accompanying passengers.

« Fare class codes and RBDs for any accompanying passengers.

« Passenger’s accompanied travel on the entire journey.

Definitions:

Accompanied Passenger : The passenger traveling at the fare component being validated against the Record 2 that requires travel with another passenger as specified in the Record 3.

Accompanying Passenger : The passenger specified in the Record 3 who is traveling with the passenger on the fare component being validated against the Record 2.

Assumptions:

In the absence of Category 13 (Record 2 for Category 13 does not exist or no Record 3 is applicable at the fare rule or general rule level), the system assumption for the Accompanied Travel category is that accompanied travel is not required for the fare component being validated.

Unless specifically coded, an accompanying passenger’s fare does not have to be from the same rule,fare class, or in the same booking code as the fare created by Categories 19-22.

--- Chunk 473 from Cat13 - Accompanied Travel.pdf ---
Unless specifically coded, an accompanying passenger’s fare does not have to be from the same rule,fare class, or in the same booking code as the fare created by Categories 19-22.

These fields are used to indicate accompanying travel requirements that must be met for the discounted fare. If these fields are not coded, then there are no travel together requirements. This could result in several errors for Galileo Web Services subscribers if the lowest applicable fares result in split bookings.

Category 13 does not apply to passengers created with category 19-22 discounts, which have their own category 13 within their category.

Same Rule

This field indicates that the discounted passenger must be accompanied by a passenger traveling at a fare governed by the same tariff/carrier/rule in order to qualify for the discount. If this field is not coded, then the accompanied passenger may be traveling at a fare governed by any tariff/rule.

Cat13 Accompanied Travel

This field indicates whether the data is a fare class code/fare family or booking code. If this field is not coded, then the accompanying passenger may be traveling at a fare governed by any fare class code or booking code.

Fare Class/Booking Code

This field is used to specify the fare class code, fare family or booking code that may or may not be used by the accompanying passenger. Fare class/fare family data in this field is matched to the Record 1 fare class code. Booking code data in this field is matched to the booking code of the flight booked. If there is not data in this field than any fare class code or booking code may be used by the accompanying passenger.

Example:

Carrier XX has filed 2 published adult fares, NFARE1 and VFARE2. NFARE‘1 has a category 19 coded that calculates 100% of the accompanied adult fare. VFARE2 has a category 19 coded that calculates 80% of the accompanied adult fare. However, same rule, same fare class/booking code has not been coded.

--- Chunk 479 from Cat13 - Accompanied Travel.pdf ---
The user has booked an itinerary and requests the lowest fare for an adult passenger and an accompanied child age 5. The illustration that follows shows that the lowest adult fare is NFARE1 requiring a booking code of N and the lowest child’s fare is VFARE2CH requiring booking code of V. This would ultimately cause the user to split the booking and FIC the child’s fare. However Galileo Web Services users are not able to FIC fares.

Recommended Filing:

Carriers who wish to require accompanied travel are urged to verify their current coding to ensure this reflects their intent. In addition all carriers are strongly urged to verify their base fare coding. For example, can the discount be applied to any ADT fare or must it be only the ADT fare filed in the same rule and tariff that the category 19 is filed in? Travelport also recommends that carriers review ATPCO’s Category 19-22 document that is available on their website www.atpco.net if further information is required.

Cat15 Sales Restrictions

CAT15 SALES RESTRICTIONS

Category 15 is used to restrict the sale of a fare by various conditions. These conditions include:

« reservations/ticketing dates

« countries/currencies of sale

« method of ticketing

« who may sell the fare

« locales where the fare may or may not be sold.

Note: Not all Category 15 functionality is currently validated by Travelport 360 Fares, as noted below.

Assumptions

Public Tariffs

When there is no Category 15 information, the fare is available for sale, ticketing, and display at all times, anywhere, and by anyone, within the confines of the other category provisions.

Private Tariffs

When there is no Category 15 information, the fare is not available for sale, ticketing, and display at any time,

anywhere, or by anyone.

Differences in Category 15 processing between Public and Airline Private Fares are shown below. Please note that if a private fare rule references Category 15 in a public general rule, the Category 15 application for

both is based on the logic for private processing.

both is based on the logic for private processing.

Category 15 data as an IF from CAT35

Should both Category 15 and Category 35 be present in the fare rule and Display Category Type is L, T, or C, 360° Fares™ will process the security data in Category 35 and the non-security data in Category 15.

data is required. The Security Table Number 983 identifies by whom and where the negotiated fare can or cannot be viewed, updated, redistributed, sold (booked), and/or ticketed (including reissued) after it has been distributed to the subscribers. All data within the Security Table Number 983 must be positively validated before processing the remainder of Category 35. When applicable security data is present in both Category 35 and Category 15 (Fare Rule, General Rule, and/or Footnote level/s), Category 35 is used for all security information, and only the non-security portion of Category 15 is validated (this applies when Category 15 is used as a Main Category). However, when Category 15 is used in the IF portion of a set (used as a Qualifying Category) in any main category, all fields are validated in Category 15, including security data (e.g. THEN Cat 5 IF Cat 15; in this case, all fields in Category 15 are validated).

NOTE: If a subscriber does not process Category 35 data, they will apply security information from Category 15 instead.

Category 15 Security for Fare-by-Rule Private Fares

If security is being filed in Category 15 (not Category 35), and the Fare By Rule (FBR) is coded to validate the Category 15 in both the base fare rule and resulting FBR rule, security must be found and passed in the resulting fare rule. There may be additional Category 15 security in the base fare rule and/or in the general rule which would have to also pass, however, the FBR rule will be checked first and must pass Category 15. If the process does not find and pass Category 15 security in the FBR rule, the base fare rule and/or general rule will not be checked.

Category 15 Security for Published Private Fares

If security is being filed in Category 15 (not Category 35), the fare rule must contain and pass the security. If the general rule or footnote also contains Category 15 security, it will be validated and must pass, however, the general rule or footnote may not contain the only security for the fare. In summary, Category 15 security filed in a general rule and/or footnote may never be the only security on a private fare.

Filing CAT17

17. HIP/MILEAGE EXCEPTIONS BETWEEN CMB AND LON THE HIGHER INTERMEDIATE POINT RULE DOES NOT APPLY FOR CONNECTIONS. AND THE HIGHER INTERMEDIATE POINT RULE DOES NOT APPLY FOR STOPOVERS.

If the rule looks like the above then It means that byte 19 is coded. Byte 19/20 of CAT 17

If you code HIP under NOTE(freeflow text) this is not being automated by any of the GDSs. However, we are extracting reports from ATPCO anytime a Cat.17 text is being added

We update the HIP table as well as the Candidate Exception table (Mon-Fri) based on the information we see in the CAT 17 report which is generated after each roll-in from ATPCO. We work a day behind so we can have the whole day's report and also because the effective date is usually the next day.

Important:

It is important that the two tables coded are stung with Relational Indicator AND

If the tables are coded with an OR relational indicator then either can be applied but not both.

HIP on NORMAL VS SPECIAL FARES

COMPARISON OF FARES fares that ARE in the same Class / Cabin must be compared!

a.HIP CHECK FOR NORMAL FARES

When comparing NORMAL FARES of the 'same class of service’ (same cabin) in order to determine if there is a higher intermediate fare, the following sequence shall be followed:

P class fare with P class fare; If no P fare, compare with F fare

F class fare with F class fare; If no F fare, compare with intermediate/business class OR if no J/C use the next lower class fare

--- Chunk 494 from CAT17 - HIP.pdf ---
P class fare with P class fare; If no P fare, compare with F fare

F class fare with F class fare; If no F fare, compare with intermediate/business class OR if no J/C use the next lower class fare

J/C class fare with J/C class fare; If no J/C fare compare with Y class fare, provided that where more than one Y class fare is published compare with the highest Y fare (instead of Y2 fare)

Y class fare with economy fare levels (like Y2 fares provided STO/TRA conditions are met).

• Using secondary fares for the HIP check: when there are 2 or more fares published for the same type of normal fare, you may use the lower or the lowest level for the HIP check subject to stopover, transfer, seasonality, day of the week rules!!!! (unlike CTM)

« The comparison shall be made in the same direction as the fare component. When using half round trip fares the comparison shall be made using half round trip fares. When using one-way fares the comparison shall be made using one-way fares.

--- Chunk 495 from CAT17 - HIP.pdf ---
e« When comparing the HIP candidates to the through fare, any Stopover Charges, Q surcharges or Mileage Increases must be excluded. Once the HIP has been determined, any applicable mileage increases applicable to the through fare will be applied to the HIP fare.

b. HIP CHECK FOR SPECIAL FARES

Special FARES HIP application is subject to normal fare HIP check. If the Hip in the normal fare is NIL, then the HIP in the special fare is NIL; there is no need to conduct a separate HIP check for the special fare.

During special fares HIP processing, the normal fares between the origin and destination of the fare component are compared with the normal fare of the same class of service between the point of origin and intermediate points and between the intermediate points and the point of destination of

the fare component to establish candidates for the special fares HIPs check. If there is no HIP the applicable special fare may be assessed.

Steps for special fare HIP check:

1. Price the fare for the journey as a normal fare

2. Identify if a normal HIP fare exist: O-I & I-D

3. Determine the applicable special fare from origin to destination

4. Identify the special fare of the same type between the points established as the HIP point for the normal fare (step 2)

5. Compare the special fare identified in step 4 to the special origin to destination(HIP special fare exist vs. no HIP exist)

REMEMBER!!!

If there is more than one special fare of the same type on the sector for which a higher normal fare applies, the fare with the conditions most similar to the conditions of the special origin-destination fare shall be used for comparison.

EXCLUSIONS FROM HIP & ADDITIONAL HIP CHECK (HIP EXCEPTIONS)

a. ignoring the HIP — INDIA

--- Chunk 497 from CAT17 - HIP.pdf ---
EXCLUSIONS FROM HIP & ADDITIONAL HIP CHECK (HIP EXCEPTIONS)

a. ignoring the HIP — INDIA

For traffic originating India and destined to Canada/USA when stopovers are taken in Europe or UK, HIP fares should not be applicable from points in Europe/UK to Canada/USA (whereas other HIPs of different category shall be considered)

b. additional HIP check TURKEY

For travel between the Middle East and Turkey involving more than one point in Turkey any HIP in Turkey must be charged whether or not a stopover is taken

c. applied on all ticketed points: Western Africa, Malawi, Israel

For journey originating Western Africa, the HIP check in each fare component shall be applied on all ticketed points in Western Africa.

For travel originating in Israel, HIP will be checked for all ticketed points from Israel. This does not apply to the HIP check from an intermediate point to another intermediate point or the fare construction point or to fares with specified routings.

HIP Check on CAT25 (Fare By Rule)

--- Chunk 498 from CAT17 - HIP.pdf ---
HIP Check on CAT25 (Fare By Rule)

The HIP check applies for private Fare by Rules provided the Fare by Rule is a calculated Fare by Rule and the Base Fare is a public fare, and dependent upon the value in the Category 17 Override field (byte 290). For private calculated FBRs where the Base Fare is a public fare, the Category 17 Override dictates whether or not the HIP check applies as follows:

Category 17 Override Value X (FBR): HIP check should not be done.

Category 17 Override Value B (Base): HIP check should be done.

NOTE: Refer to Section 4.6 Category Override Tags in this document for further information on the application of the Category Override fields.

Travelport does all the HIP processing based on the base fare and then apply the CAT25 discounts over public HIP candidate to get the HIP amount for private fare.

(e.g. Base Fare fare class code, Base Fare fare type code, Base Fare carrier, etc.)

UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED NOTE GENERAL RULE DOES NOT

THE HIGHER INTERMEDIATE POINT RULE DOES NOT APPLY FOR CONNECTIONS.

Customer asked why we applied a HIP when there is no stopover.

Resolution:

The system is pricing the itinerary correctly according to the fare construction Since the system is breaking off the side trip DOH-BAH-DOH as a separate Stand Alone Pricing Unit. DOH is now considered as a stopover and not a connection as shown for the whole itinerary, thus creating a HIP (higher intermediate point) This is from IATA reso: 017c

vii) when the ticket shows no stopover at both the unit origin and the unit destination point of a side trip which has been charged separately (due to transfer connections on both occasions) a stopover shall be considered to be taken at such point unless the time interval between the arrival immediately preceding the side trip and the departure immediately following the side trip does not constitute a stopover as defined in Resolution 012.

ENDORSEMENTS

There are no ATPCO Data Apps for CAT 18 Endorsements

Industry standards in Electronic Ticketing allow up to 147 characters of Endorsement/Restrictions to be exchanged in various formats between GDSs and Airlines.

In Apollo endorsements have two categories, system generated endorsements automatically added as part of a fare quote response and Manual endorsements added by the agent.

Apollo generates up to 6 lines of endorsements, each with a maximum of 29 characters (including spaces) to the e-ticket vendors. However, you can manually add only 3 lines with a maximum of 29 characters each using the endorsement ticketing modifier

--- Chunk 503 from Cat18- Endorsements.pdf ---
Although Apollo sends 6 lines of endorsements, they may not appear on the issued e-ticket or in the order entered. Airlines have their own restrictions as to the maximum number of characters visible on an issued e-ticket. Programmatic endorsements appear on the ticket first followed by any manual endorsements. Use endorsements when you need to add special restrictions on a ticket that have not been added automatically as part of the fare quote, such as a transatlantic ticket which needs to be issued in conjunction with domestic US flights. To add an endorsement, use the generic ticketing modifier (G) followed by the endorsement box (EB) modifier.

Galileo will send up to 6 lines of endorsements, each with a maximum of 29 characters to the e-ticket vendors. However, only 3 lines with a maximum of 29 characters each can be added manually using a ticketing modifier entry. Please Note: Although Galileo send this amount of characters this does not mean they will all display on the issued e-ticket or in the order entered. All airlines have their own restrictions as to the maximum number of characters visible on an issued e-ticket.

--- Chunk 504 from Cat18- Endorsements.pdf ---
1P The 5-ER Field is a single field permitting a maximum of 58 characters.

A maximum of one line of 58 characters prints on H1 stock. Amaximum of two lines of 29 characters each print on A1/F1 stock. If two lines of endorsements are necessary, both lines must be entered at the same time separated with an asterisk.

Many endorsements can be added to the 5-ER field through the use of 2-character endorsement codes. The system will automatically decode these endorsement codes and print the appropriate information on the ticket.

Endorsements are used on a ticket to specify restrictions applicable to that document. Within the system, endorsements are classified into two categories; system generated (programmatic) endorsements

automatically included as part of the stored ticket record and agent added (manual) endorsements

You cannot override the system generated endorsements, but you may add extra endorsements if required. When using Rate Desk Pricing all endorsements will be entered manually. They can also be entered into the PNR using the 5 field. Worldspan will accept up to a maximum of 147 characters of

Cat2 Day & Time

CAT2 DAY & TIME

In order to validate Category 2, it is essential to know the following:

« Day/Time of each flight within the fare component.

« Departure/Arrival day/time for all flights within the pricing unit or journey because the inclusion of a Travel Segment Indicator (TSI) and the setting of the assumption override tag in this category can modify the application of the system assumption.

Assumptions

The assumptions for Day/Time application are:

« When there is no Category 2 information (no Category 2, Record 2 that resolves to the fare, including Record 2 match, inbound/outbound directional indicators, Geographic Specifications and date overrides), then the fare is valid for all days of the week and/or times of day within the confines of the other category provisions.

« Once there is data present for Category 2 that resolves to the fare, the assumption is that the data applies to the departure day and time of the origin flight of the fare component.

--- Chunk 507 from Cat2 - Day & Time.pdf ---
« Once there is data present for Category 2 that resolves to the fare, the assumption is that the data applies to the departure day and time of the origin flight of the fare component.

The ability to override this assumption and state that the data applies to departure from the origin of the pricing unit is provided within the category (Byte 58, Application Tag). The presence of a TSI and/or Geo Locs within Category 2 can further modify where the application of day/time restrictions are to be applied within the fare component. Additionally, there is the ability to further modify the category application with Byte 58 (Application Tag), to indicate where the restrictions of day/time should be applied within the pricing unit; i.e., a TSI alone does not modify the application of Category 2. It is important to note that the TSI or Geo Specification does not modify the Category Application from fare component to pricing unit; it only further identifies where the application of the time/days are to be measured from. Additionally, use of an arrival TSI can override the departure application of the category, causing the data to apply to the arrival at the point specified by the TSI.

--- Chunk 508 from Cat2 - Day & Time.pdf ---
Application Tag Byte 58

Here is an example where Travelport correctly fails to price due to CAT2 Failure of the App Tag Byte 58

https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/FaresAndPricing/Content/Cat2 DayTime.htm

Cat2 Day & Time

As you can see the Airline expected to pass pricing because S4 is on a Tuesday ex HKG.

Byte 58 in CAT2 (APPL field) has two input options, BLANK or X. If blank then system assumption is that day/time restrictions apply to the whole fare component. If X then it is pricing unit.

This one was blank so we failed NRT-HKG as it is MON Also an Airline can use the GEOTBLNO field #995 which indicates the portion of travel to which the day/time restriction applies. In this case it was BLANK. Here is the ATPCO data application text for this byte.

--- Chunk 509 from Cat2 - Day & Time.pdf ---
The Application Tag is used to indicate whether the day/time provisions apply to the departure from the fare component origin or pricing unit origin. When the Application Tag is BLANK, the day/time restrictions apply to the departure from the first flight segment of the fare component. When the Application Tag is set, it overrides the fare component assumption, and the day/time restrictions apply to the departure from the first flight segment of the pricing unit.

The Application Tag may be used alone or in combination with data in the Geo Spec Table #995.

Therefore we correctly fail and if the airline intended to price it would be necessary to code Byte 58 with X and add the O/D in the #995 table.

Day of Week Indicator

In order to match a sequence for a fare valid on a specific day of the week the day of week indicator should be filed in both Record 1 Fare Application and the Cat2 Record 2. As per ATPCO data application If you only file in the Record 2 the system will no match and move on to process the next sequence.

CAT25 FARE BY RULE

Carriers may use ATPCO automated Category 25 to create public or private world wide Fare by Rule fares for distribution, sales, and ticketing.

Customers can create selling fares based upon airline net fares. The net fares can be specified fares or net fares created using Category 25. The base fares referenced on the 989 Base Fare Table or the resulting Category 25 display must be C

Record 8

Record 8 is the starting point for the Fare by Rule process. It is the necessary link between a passenger’s itinerary and the matching Category 25 data. The data coded in the Record 8 MUST match the associated data coded in Category 25.

Each Record 8 ID must include:

« Primary Passenger Type Code of resulting fares being created

« Specific geography of resulting Category 25 fares being created

Stringing Logic

Fare by Rule string processing differs from other categories in the Automated Rules Product as follows: • Record 3 for Category 25 can only be used as a main category. This Category can never be used as an IF condition, nor can it be used with AND or OR in the IF portion of a set.

Fare by Rule string processing differs from other categories in the Automated Rules Product as follows: • Edits prevent AND tables for Category 25.

--- Chunk 515 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
« Refer to Category 25 Record 2 Data Application for detailed explanation and examples of string processing.

Primary Passenger Type Code

The Record 8 Primary Passenger Type Code is an exact match to the Category 25 Resulting Fare Passenger Type Code that will be coded in the Category 25 Record 3 table.

360° Fares™ supports all ATPCO Passenger Type Codes.

Specific geography

Geography must be coded on every Record 8.

ATPCO has introduced Table 978 User Defined Zone Tables that can be utilized in Record 8. User Defined Zone Tables allow for specific city codes to be coded within a single User Defined Zone Table that can be used in multiple Category 25 rules. This allows for carriers to code their online destinations, thus eliminating any markets from having Category 25 fares created when they would not be applicable. 360° Fares™ strongly encourages carriers to utilize Table 978 where ever applicable. As many U.S./Canada transborder contracts are valid for online destinations only, 360°Fares recommends that the zone tables are utilized when there are only a few transborder destinations serviced by the filing carrier.

--- Chunk 516 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
Record 8 processing can be coded for IATA defined City Codes. Airport codes cannot be processed. If an airport code is coded, 360° Fares™ will not match to that location. Should a Fare by Rule fare be unique for a specific airport code, utilize Category 4 Flight Application in the Fare by Rule Fare to validate against the airport code.

Directional Indicator

The Record 8 Directional Indicator should be used when fare selection discounts fares in a single direction. For example, the specific geography filed is LON to HKG; however the Category 25 calculation is for fares originating LON only. The directional indicator in Record 8 should be coded.

Qualifying Account Code

This is optional and can be up to 20 alpha numeric characters where the first character must be an alpha. If an account code is to be used in the Fare by Rule, the account code should also be coded in the Record 8 but it is not mandatory. A Record 8 with a BLANK Account Code will match all Account Codes.

It is the agency who should request, or at least be aware of the account code that the carrier will use.

A good example of multiple Account Codes is below

360° Fares™ does not support this field as the functionality is similar to the Qualifying Account Code. Any data coded as the Qualifying Ticket Designator will be the indicator that that speciRecord 8 is not valid for a360° Fares™ customer. The Qualifying Ticket Designator in Record 8 is not used for final ticketing of the Fare by Rule. That information is obtained from Category 35 or Categories 19-22 or Category 25 Record 3. Category 25 Record 2

Passenger and Record 8 data are used to match the Cat 25 Record 2. Category 25 Record 2 points to the applicable Category 25 Record 3 data which contains the information necessary to create the fare.

Loc 1 and Loc 2

Each Category 25 Record 2 should be coded with the broadest geography applicable utilizing 978 Zone Tables in the LOC fields whenever possible.

Category 25 Record 3

The Category 25 Record 3 string should be kept as short as possible. Utilize Wildcard Resulting Fare Codes if needed. 360° Fares™ recommends not exceeding 25 Record 3 tables within a single Record 2 sequence.

Resulting Passenger Type Code

The Resulting Passenger Type Code must be an exact match to the Record 8 Primary Passenger Type Code. The Resulting Passenger Type Code must also be an exact match to the Passenger Type Code found in Category 1 Eligibility if applicable.

If a self-booking engine is processing the Category 25 fares, the resulting passenger type code must ‘ADT’.

Resulting Display Category

Display Category Type value L, T, or C identifies that the Resulting Fare is a Negotiated Fare and specifies whether the Resulting Fare amount is a Selling Fare amount of a Net Fare amount. Category 35 is only interrogated if a Display Category Type value L, T, or C is present.

Display Category Type values E, S, N, G, or | identify that the Resulting Fare is not a Negotiated Fare. They are defined as follows: E = Excursion, S = Status, N = Normal, G = Group, | = Inclusive tour package. When any of these display category type values are present, Category 35 will not be interrogated.

360° Fares™ recommends that the Resulting Display Category Type always be coded in the Record 3, provided this does not increase the number of Category 25 Record 3 tables.

Resulting Pricing Category

The types valid are N = Normal fare, S= Special fare. The N or S further defines the fare as a Normal or Special which may be needed to during combinability.

--- Chunk 521 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
Resulting Pricing Category

360° Fares™ recommends that the Resulting Pricing Category always be coded in the Record 3, provided this does not increase the number of Category 25 Record 3 tables.

Resulting Fare Wildcard

360° Fares™ supports the ATPCO enhancement for filing a wildcard asterisk (*) in order to create a new resulting fare class code. This enhancement will combine the first character of the base fare class code with the characters that follow the asterisk.

For example:

Category 25 Record 3 Resulting Fare Class is coded *WEB.

Base fare class code is Q1R.

Result:

The created Category 25 fare class code would be QWEB.

Resulting Routing

360° Fares™ supports the ATPCO enhancement for wildcard routings. This allows the vendor to apply any published routing or any published routing and MPMs (for international fares only).

Category 25 Category Overrides

The individual category fields specify whether processing must validate fare rule and general rule data for the Fare by Rule only, the Base Fare only, or both. Valid entries in each of the category fields follow:

X = Fare by Rule only.

Processing should only validate the Fare by Rule fare rule and general rule data for the specified category. The Base Fare fare rule and general rule should not be validated.

B = Base Fare only.

Processing should only validate the Base Fare fare rule and general rule data for the specified category. The Fare by Rule fare rule and general rule should not be validated.

360° Fares™ processes each of the individual category fields per ATPCO specifications. All base fare rule data and override rule data is processed as automated rule data.

989 Base Fare Table

360° Fares™ recommends that the base fare tariff, carrier, and passenger type code are always coded in every 989 Base Fare Table. When coding a private base fare tariff, 360° Fares™ strongly recommends that the applicable fare code(s) are always coded.

Both positive and negative applications are permitted in the 989 Base Fare Table. When both positive and negative applications are to be coded, all of the negative applications must be sequenced before any positive applications. 360° Fares™ will not process the 989 table if negative applications are mixed in with positive applications.

Security

360° Fares™ supports both the use of Category 15, as well as Category 35 for security purposes.

--- Chunk 524 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
Security

360° Fares™ supports both the use of Category 15, as well as Category 35 for security purposes.

If the resulting Category 25 fares have both Category 15 and Category 35 present, 360° Fares™ will process the security data in Category 35, and the security and the non-security data in Category 15. However, it is strongly recommended that security always be coded only in the resulting FBR rule and not in the base rule.

Category 25 Creation of Category 35 Fare

360° Fares™ supports the use of resulting Display Category value of L, T, or C. Fares with these values are:

L Identifies the Negotiated Fare amount filed as a Selling fare amount.

T Identifies the Negotiated Fare amount as a Net fare amount with a specified or calculated Selling fare amount in Category 35 Table 979.

C — Identifies the negotiated fare amount filed as a net fare amount.

The selling fare amount requires updating for at least one seller. This code is used when the selling fare amount is not addressed in category 35 table 979 or is defined as a range in Category 35 table 979.

Category 25 — Frequently Asked Questions

What is Fare by Rule?

Airlines can file Fare by Rule (Category 25) via ATPCO and SITA to instruct Travelport 360 Fares with

the formula to create worldwide discounts off published and private fares or to create specified fares.

Travelport 360 Fares will dynamically create the fares for fare display and pricing.

Can the resulting fare display category in Category 25 be left blank?

Yes. If any of the resulting fare fields are left blank, the resulting fare will take that characteristic from the base fare. However, if there is a Category 35 in the rule, the resulting display category MUST be coded with a C, L, or T.

With Fare by Rule fares should | code the account code in the Record 8 or in Category 1?

--- Chunk 527 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
With Fare by Rule fares should | code the account code in the Record 8 or in Category 1?

Record 8 should ALWAYS contain an account code if it is to be used. Category 1 can be filed with an account code at the same time. Just note, that the passenger type on the Record 8 must match that of the passenger type being coded in Category 1

Can constructed fares be created in Category 25 Fare by Rule?

No. A constructed fare can be used as a base fare to calculate a discount, but constructed fares are not created from FBR processing.

Is there any difference between Fare by Rule and Category 25?

No, they are one and the same. Fare by Rule (FBR) is the name for Category 25. Category 25 is the official automated rule category number assigned by ATPCO and SITA.

Can | use Category 35 or Category 15 to control security with Fare by Rule?

Yes. Travelport 360 Fares supports processing of security in either category.

How can | tell if the fare displayed is published or a Fare by Rule fare?

How can | tell if the fare displayed is published or a Fare by Rule fare?

https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/FaresAndPricing/Content/Cat25 Fare By Rule.htm

Cat25 Fare By Rule

From the tariff display, the Rules Follow-on request will show all applicable categories for the fare. the fare is a Fare By Rule fare, ‘25. Fare by Rule’ will be displayed. If ‘25. Fare by Rule’ is not shown, then the fare is a published fare.

How can | tell if the Fare by Rule fare is calculated or specified?

From the tariff display, for calculated Fare by Rule fares, the $V1/0, FN*1/0 or 4F.R1#ALL entry will display the Fare by Rule number and Fare by Rule tariff number as well as the base fare rule and base fare tariff number in Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan. For specified Fare by Rule fares, only the Fare by Rule number and Fare by Rule tariff number are displayed.

Does Travelport 360 Fares apply MPM surcharges to fares created from Fare by Rule?

MPM surcharges will be applied to fare by rule fares if applicable

ATPCO defines tariffs with geography. For example, FBRNAPV is the fare by rule tariff for North America. Does the fare by rule processing use this geo definition?

--- Chunk 529 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
ATPCO defines tariffs with geography. For example, FBRNAPV is the fare by rule tariff for North America. Does the fare by rule processing use this geo definition?

Yes. 360Fares adheres to the geographical definitions of the Fare by Rule tariffs and only creates fares that fall within the tariff geography.

Does Travelport 360 Fares process base fare rule overrides?

Yes, rule category overrides are processed per ATPCO and SITA specifications. Coding can instruct use of base fare rules, fare by rule rules or a combination of both for most categories.

Can the General Rules be applied to Fare by Rule fares?

Yes. Instruct ATPCO or SITA to point your existing general rules to your Fare by Rule tariffs.

When coding geography, is it preferred that | code it in the Record 8 or in Category 25?

Because Record 8 is the starting point, it is preferred that specific geography is coded here.

Should | code the ticketing and travel dates of the FBR fares in Category 25, Category 14, or Category 15?

Travelport 360 Fares will process the dates in all of these categories. This would be the filing carrier’s choice of where to code the applicable dates.

--- Chunk 530 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
Travelport 360 Fares will process the dates in all of these categories. This would be the filing carrier’s choice of where to code the applicable dates.

Should | code the tour code in Category 27 or Category 35?

Either category can be coded to print a resulting tour code on the ticket. However, if both categories are coded with different tour codes, only the tour code found in Category 35 will print on the ticket.

Should | code the resulting ticket designator in Category 25 or Category 35?

Either category can be coded to print a resulting ticket designator on the ticket. However, if both categories are coded with different ticket designators, only the ticket designator found in category 35 will print on the ticket.

What is the recommended practice in only creating FBR fares for my carrier’s on-line cities?

--- Chunk 531 from Cat25 - Fare By Rule.pdf ---
What is the recommended practice in only creating FBR fares for my carrier’s on-line cities?

Utilize ZONE TABLES in the Record 8! Zone tables are a wonderful feature for this very reason. Zone tables can contain cities, states, provinces, countries, areas, and/or ATP zones. A carrier is able to create and reuse the Zonal Tables in any Fare by Rule and thus reduce the number of invalid fares being created. Zone tables can also be code in the Record 2 of Category 25.

What should | use in the Record 8 and Record 2, the airport or city code?

The record 8 and Record 2 may have an airport code or a city code filed, however, both would be treated as city code for processing logic (hence the first match stops the process).

CATS SEASONALITY

In order to validate the Seasonality Category, it is essential to know the following:

Departure/arrival date for all flights within the fare component, pricing unit and journey. (The inclusion of a Travel Segment Indicator (TSI) and the setting of the Assumption Override Tag in this category can modify the application of the assumption from departure of the originating flight of the pricing unit to the departure of the originating flight of the fare component or journey).

It is important to know whether each portion is Outbound or Inbound, this is especially important when selecting a TSI

Review all fare break points within the pricing unit and measure each of those points from the point of origin of the pricing unit to determine the furthest geographical fare break point (point of turnaround).

Outbound = All fare components within the pricing unit prior to the furthest geographical fare break point.

Inbound = All fare components within the pricing unit after the furthest geographical fare break point are considered Inbound.

--- Chunk 535 from Cat3 - Seasonality.pdf ---
Inbound = All fare components within the pricing unit after the furthest geographical fare break point are considered Inbound.

All fare components within the pricing unit that are selected in the opposite direction of the passenger's travel is INBOUND travel”

Assumptions

In the absence of Category 3 (Record 2 does not exist, or no Record is applicable), the system assumption is that there are no seasonal date(s) restrictions that apply for the fare.

When the Seasonality Category is applicable, the assumption is:

« “The date of departure of the originating flight of the pricing unit’ determines the seasonality of the fare component being validated.”

Please check category 3 data application “2.2 Assumptions” for further details in https://my.atpco.net/system/files ?file=document_nodes/2021-06/Cat3_dapp_C.pdf.

CAT35 NEGOTIATED FARES

To view how to troubleshoot missing CAT35 fares click here

Overview

The Negotiated Fare Product brings organization and more control to the creation, distribution, and implementation of negotiated fares. The design utilizes the current fare system, Fare By Rule product (to include Record 8, Category 25 and Table Number 989), Category 35 — Negotiated Fare Restrictions, Security Table 983, and Fare Creator Table 979. The design enables a carrier to file negotiated fares based on specific markets or zones, with restricted sale and distribution. The negotiated fare has multiple fare levels associated to it: the net amount remitted to the carrier, the selling fare level, and the gross or ticketed fare level. In addition, the negotiated fare level has the associated commission and ticketing requirements for the fare.

--- Chunk 537 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
This design includes utilizing both the current fare system and automated rules system to allow for the distribution of negotiated fares and rule provisions. Category 35 — Negotiated Fare Restrictions was created to accommodate this design. Category 35 holds all the Negotiated Fare Restrictions information for both filed negotiated fares and negotiated fares created through the Fare By Rule product. The Category includes these three parts:

1. Security (Table Number 983) — who can or cannot view, update, redistribute, sell, and/or ticket (including reissue) the negotiated fare after it has been distributed to the applicable subscribers.

2. Fare Calculation (Fare Creator Table Number 979) — the ability to create the other level of the fare (either Net Submitted Fare Amount or Selling Fare Amount).

3. Commission and Ticketing Requirements.

Coding Conventions

Security Table 983

* Sequencing:

« Sequence from most restrictive to least restrictive.

Negative sequences should be followed by positive sequences within equal restrictive data.

• Atleast one positive sequence is required.

--- Chunk 538 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
« Sequence from most restrictive to least restrictive.

Negative sequences should be followed by positive sequences within equal restrictive data.

• Atleast one positive sequence is required.

Childrens Discounts

If discounts apply based on Categories 19-22 and Table 979 specifies a selling amount, the associated Category 35 Record 3 should have data in the PTC field (bytes 22-24) indicating that the data in Table 979 only applies for a specified PTC. If data is not in the PTC field, then the specified selling amount in Table 979 applies to all PTCs, regardless of discount data in Categories 19-22

Display Category Type

https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/FaresAndPricing/Content/Cat35 Negotiated Fares.htm

Cat35 Negotiated Fares

When Display Category is value L, Table 979 must not contain a selling amount (Table 979 is not required; however, if present, it must contain a net amount). Table 983 must contain Update (byte 49) value N.

When Display Category is value T, Table 979 must contain a specified or calculated selling amount (ranges are not permitted). Table 983 must contain Update (byte 49) value N.

--- Chunk 539 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
When Display Category is value T, Table 979 must contain a specified or calculated selling amount (ranges are not permitted). Table 983 must contain Update (byte 49) value N.

Display Category value C is required whenever Table 979 contains a range selling amount and Table 983 Update (byte 49) is value Y. Value C is used when the selling amount for at least one fare requires updating.

Processing Laws for Display Category Type

If Display Category Type code is not L, T, or C (not a negotiated fares Display Category Type), Category 35 has no application. Do not attempt to process any data in Category 35. (Even if data exists in Category 35 that may resolve to the fare being processed, this data is not applicable and should not be applied.)

If Display Category Type code is value L the following is valid: • Applicable Table 979 with net amount and Table 983 without update authority

If Display Category Type code is value L the following is valid: • No applicable Table 979

If Display Category Type code is value L the following is valid:

If Display Category Type code is value T the following is valid:

--- Chunk 540 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
If Display Category Type code is value L the following is valid:

If Display Category Type code is value T the following is valid:

eo Applicable Table 979 with specified/calculated selling amount and Table 983 without update authority

If Display Category Type code is value C the following is valid:

o Applicable Table 979 with range selling amounts and Table 983 with update authority

o Applicable Table 979 with specified/calculated selling amount and Table 983 without update authority

eo No applicable Table 979 and Table 983 with update authority

If Table 983 permits update authority (Update byte 49 is value Y), then the Display Category Type must be value C.

o Invalid data may result in a fail condition (refer to the examples below).

NOTE 1: The application of the negotiated fares Display Category Type in relation to Category 35 data only applies to subscribers that process Category 35. Subscribers that do not process Category 35 may still receive Record 1s with any of the Negotiated Fares Display Category Types in which case the subscriber should process Category 15 instead of Category 35.

--- Chunk 541 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
NOTE 2: In public tariffs, edits prevent entering Category 35 data, and edits prevent entering negotiated fares Display Category Type values.

Point of Sale Restrictions

When security restrictions, fare calculation, Method Type, commission information, and/or ticketing information are differentiated by the point of sale, use the relational indicator IF to Category 15 to specify the point of sale point.

Fare Creator Table 979

Sequence from most restrictive to least restrictive.

When Table 979 is present but not matched, processing will fail the Category 35 Record 3 table; therefore, once geographic data is present in a sequence, a higher numbered sequence and/or another Category 35 Record 3 is required to encompass all other applicable origin/destination points for the fare.

When Net/Selling Indicator (byte 51) is value N (Net Submit Fare), Display Category Type must be value L (filed fare is a selling fare). If not value L, fail.

When Net/Selling Indicator (byte 51) is value S (Selling Fare), Display Category Type must be value T or C (filed fare is a net submit fare). If not value T or C, fail

When a range is specified, Table 983 Update (byte 49) must be value Y.

--- Chunk 542 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
When a range is specified, Table 983 Update (byte 49) must be value Y.

Higher Intermediate Point (HIP)

When Category 35 is present, Higher Intermediate Point (HIP) checks only apply when all of the following conditions apply:

« The fare is a private Fare by Rule created via Category 25.

The Fare by Rule is a calculated Fare by Rule and the base fare is a public fare.

• The Fare by Rule Category 17 Override field is value B.

« Display Category Code for the Resulting Fare is type L (selling fare amount)

« Category 35 Table 979 does not contain a net fare amount.

Refer to Data Application for Category 25 Fare by Rule for detailed information on the application of HIP checks for Fare by Rules.

Ticketing

« When Method Type (byte 33) is value 2, 3, or 4, Tour Code/Value Code/CAR Code Type byte 105 must be value T or C.

--- Chunk 543 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
Ticketing

« When Method Type (byte 33) is value 2, 3, or 4, Tour Code/Value Code/CAR Code Type byte 105 must be value T or C.

« When data is present in Ticketing Carrier Restrictions Indicator (byte 98), data must also be present in Carrier (bytes 100-102). When data is present in Indicator (byte 98) and Carrier (bytes 100-102) is blank, the application of data is the same as if all Carrier Restrictions fields were blank (bytes 100-102 were blank): ticket issue is not restricted to the owning/publishing carrier plate or stock or any other carrier plate or stock

Data on the audit coupon and data on the passenger coupon is the same unless specifically instructed/coded otherwise by the carrier.

« When Ticketed Fare Data Indicator (byte 136) is value A or B, data should not be present in Fare Box bytes 173-194. If data is present in Fare Box bytes 173-194, then Fare Box data overrides the data in the Indicator field, and the data in the Fare Box field will be placed in the Fare Box on the ticket.

--- Chunk 544 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
« When data is present in Ticketed Fare Data bytes 136-172, data must also be present in Indicator byte 136. If data is not present in Indicator byte 136, then processing does not know whether to retrieve the fare class only or the fare class and the associated fare amount. In this case, the data in bytes 136-172 has no application. The Fare Class Code for the fare being processed should be placed in the Fare Basis/Ticket Designator Box on the ticket. The Selling Amount for the fare being processed should be placed in the Fare Box on the ticket, unless otherwise specified in Fare Box bytes 173-194

Commission

On the Galileo system, CAT 35 Commission is part of the CAT 35 Net Ticketing Functionality.

If a pcc is not activated to CAT 35 Net Ticketing Functionality (AAT field NGGF-N), the commission filed

CAT 35 is not applied. Instead the commission from the default Galileo Commission table is applied.

If commission is filed via Airline Private Fares Category 35 and/or APF Private Fares then the following logic is applied:

If commission information exists and “matches” then it can not be changed or overridden.

--- Chunk 545 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
If commission is filed via Airline Private Fares Category 35 and/or APF Private Fares then the following logic is applied:

If commission information exists and “matches” then it can not be changed or overridden.

If commission information does not exist then it can be added / modified.

If commission information exists but does not match, i.e. conflicts, then it can be added or modified.

If commission is absent then the user can modify or add or the system will go to default values that are applicable by airline/fare/market.

Cat35 Negotiated Fares

Activation of the NGGF field is not actually the turning on/off of CAT35 fares in a market.It is a setting in customer PCC relating to the display of specific data.

If a CAT35 fare is filed in a PCC that has Private Fares capability then the fare would display/price with or without NGGF activated.

The commission filed in a CAT35 would however not be applied to tickets issued in the PCC if NGGF is not activated. The default commission from the country table would be applied.

--- Chunk 546 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
The commission filed in a CAT35 would however not be applied to tickets issued in the PCC if NGGF is not activated. The default commission from the country table would be applied.

*** MANUAL INPUT NEEDED BEFORE TICKETING ***

This error occurs when there is a commission conflict within CAT35. For example two fares are combined and the first one has 0% and the second one has no commission or any value other than 0%

When ticketed together this is considered a commission conflict and requires the commission be entered manually.

The Net Ticketing Detail Screen would reflect:

COMMISSION: *** MANUAL INPUT NEEDED BEFORE TICKETING ***

LYSRAI: 000.0000 PCT

SIDLYS: 000.0000 PCT

The commission would need to be entered manually at the time of ticketing or System processing then applies the commission from the Default Commission Table.

Fares

360° Fares™ supports both the use of Category 15 and Category 35 for security purposes.

Display Category Type values E, S, N, G, or | identify that the Resulting Fare is not a Negotiated Fare. When any of these display category type values are present in the Record 1 or Category 25 Record 3 table, Category 35 will not be interrogated.

Display Category Type value L, T, or C identifies that the Fare is a Negotiated Fare. Category 35 is only interrogated if a Display Category Type value L, T, or C is present in the Record 1 or Category 25 Record 3 table.

Should both Category 15 and Category 35 be present in the fare rule and Display Category Type is L, T, or C, 360° Fares™ will process the security data in Category 35 and the non-security data in Category 15.

For Negotiated Fares processing, the security found in Category 35 983 table must pass. Should Category 15 also exist in the same rule where Category 35 processing has passed, processing will continue to Category 15 where non-security will be validated and surety data will be ignored.

--- Chunk 548 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
*Rule validation processing will continue when Category 35 passes validation and Category 15 does not fail validation. A result of Pass or No Match will continue processing. A result of Fail would stop processing and prevent the fares from being created for fare quote and fare display.

4.1.1 Security Table Number 983 — Bytes 14-21

The Security Table Number 983 data is carrier-instructed information located at the Category 35 — Negotiated Fare Restrictions level. When a Record 3 Category 35 is present, Security Table Number 983 data is required. The Security Table Number 983 identifies by whom and where the negotiated fare can or cannot be viewed, updated, redistributed, sold (booked), and/or ticketed (including reissued) after it has been distributed to the subscribers. All data within the Security Table Number 983 must be positively validated before processing the remainder of Category 35. When applicable security data is present in both Category 35 and Category 15 (Fare Rule, General Rule, and/or Footnote level/s), Category 35 is used for all security information, and only the non-security portion of Category 15 is validated (this applies when Category 15 is used as a Main Category). However, when Category 15 is used in the IF portion of a set (used as a Qualifying Category) in any main category, all fields are validated in Category 15, including security data (e.g. THEN Cat 5 IF Cat 15; in this case, all fields in Category 15 are validated).

Passenger Types in Category 35

For published fares, when using a passenger type in Category 35 to associate security and/or other Category 35 features such as tour code to certain passenger types, all applicable passenger types must also be coded in the Record1 of the published fare. If ADT applies, include ADT as the last passenger type in the Record 1. If the passenger type field in Record 1 is left blank and all the records in Category 35 have passenger types coded, the desired result will not be achieved.

Child & Infant & Other PTC Filing

When filing a Private Fare with discounts for any PTC other than ADT it is mandatory to file an IF CAT1 table for each PTC.

A Passenger type of ADT in Category 1 does not match ALL passenger types; it only matches ADT. Therefore, when category 35 is filed with an IF to Category 1 for a passenger type and, if applicable, account code and other associated PTCs (i.e. CNN, INF) are also eligible for the fare, the string must contain an OR Category 1 for each passenger type. An OR CAT01 is needed for all the primary passenger

3Although ATPCO allows other data in this field (e.g. the actual word ‘BULK’), IATA restricts what may actually print in the fare box. It is expected that the 360° Fares™ Automated Rules Ticketing Interface project will include edits to prevent invalid text from being entered from Category 35.

Tour Codes (type T)

As there are currently no industry standards as to how to apply tour codes, particularly when conflicts exist, the following outlines 360° Fares™ processing:

Tour Codes can be filed in Category 27 — Tours or Category 35 — Negotiated Fares.

--- Chunk 557 from Cat35 - Negotiated Fares.pdf ---
Tour Codes can be filed in Category 27 — Tours or Category 35 — Negotiated Fares.

If a single fare component contains a tour code in Category 27 and in Category 35, the tour code in Cat 35 overrides Cat 27.

Tour code conflicts within a single category (multiple fares), fail to quote. Meaning, that if the outbound has a tour code and the inbound has a different tour code, we will fail to quote the pricing solution.

For multiple fares, if one fare has a tour code, the other does not; this is not considered a conflict. We quote and the tour code from the first fare component will print on the ticket. If the first fare does not contain a tour code, then one will not print on the ticket.

Cat4 Flight Application

CAT4 FLIGHT APPLICATION

In order to validate the Flight Application Category, it is essential to know the following:

« The direction of travel on the fare being validated

¢ All flight numbers

« All points on the ticket

¢ All points within the line of flight (hidden or unticketed points)

« All types of equipment being used for the travel.

« Marketing and Operating carriers on each sector

¢ Tariff applicable to the fare component being processed (for RTW/CT fares)

ATPCO has defined how to validate Operating Carrier for the purposes of ATPCO Automated Rules Flight Table 986, which in turn is used to define eligible carriers in Category 4 — Flight Application, and in Record 8 —Fare By Rule Application.

The Operating Carrier is:

--- Chunk 559 from Cat4 - Flight Application.pdf ---
The Operating Carrier is:

The carrier who owns the schedule record (SSIM file) unless that record contains a value in the DEI050 field which identifies the operating carrier of the segment. DEI050 [Duplicate Leg Reference — Operational Leg ID] is a data element found in a SSIM file (Standard Schedules and Information Manual). In order to use this product, carriers should file the operating carrier (and operating carrier flight number) in the DEI050 of the schedules record (as opposed to the DEIO27). (ATPCO will add this recommended practice to the reference manual for this product.) If carriers do not file a value in DEI050, systems will assume the marketing carrier and flight number are the same as the operating carrier and flight number.

Travelport 360 Fares relies on DEI050 and the Airline Designator to determine the Operating Carrier for validation of ATPCO Table 986 in Category 4 and Record 8.

• If the flight schedule contains a DEIO50, then the carrier shown in that data element is considered to be the Operating Carrier.

If the flight schedule does not contain a DEIO50, then the carrier shown as the Airline Designator is considered the Operating Carrier.

--- Chunk 560 from Cat4 - Flight Application.pdf ---
If the flight schedule does not contain a DEIO50, then the carrier shown as the Airline Designator is considered the Operating Carrier.

This category can be validated per fare component or per pricing unit. If validated as a fare component, each portion between fare breaks is validated. If validated as a pricing unit, the whole journey is validated.

Assumptions

In the absence of Category 4 (Record 2 for Category 4 does not exist or no Category 4 Record 3 is applicable within the string), the system assumption for Category 4 Flight Application is that there are no flight restrictions other than those specified within the routing or transfer category.

The assumption for applying the Flight Application conditions is by fare component. The fare component is dependent upon itself to validate the provisions, except when Byte 60 (Outbound/Inbound Indicator) contains a value of 3, 4, or 5. When Byte 60 contains a value 3, 4, or 5, Flight Application conditions apply by pricing unit; to validate a fare component, it may be necessary to know information about the other fare component(s) within the pricing unit.

--- Chunk 561 from Cat4 - Flight Application.pdf ---
https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/FaresAndPricing/Content/Cat4 Flight Application.htm

Cat4 Flight Application

Category 4 Flight Application provides the capability to state flights operated by one carrier but marketed by another carrier. Category 4 also provides the ability to identify all carriers that may or may not participate on a given fare component. Pricing Analysts should always discuss with their Scheduling Analysts how a codeshare flight was filed prior to coding any Category 4 data that may be specific to the operating carrier.

Recommended Filing

--- Chunk 562 from Cat4 - Flight Application.pdf ---
Recommended Filing

Analysts should review each fare with Category 4 provisions to ensure the flight application restricting the use of a fare meets with the carrier’s intent. If the category is not coded carefully, the fare may be used for flight applications that the carrier does not intend to permit. Pricing Analysts should always discuss with their Scheduling Analysts how a codeshare flight was filed prior to coding any Category 4 data that may be specific to the operating carrier. If the scheduling department has opted to not file the operating carrier’s two letter carrier code in the DEI050 field of the flight's SSIM file, the pricing analyst is not able to use the two letter operating carrier code in Category 4 Flight Application.

CODING CONVENTIONS

When multiple Record 3 tables are identified with a relational indicator of AND:

For all tables that match based on the Application/Via Indicator value ‘2” (bytes 61 or 79), all information for only those matched tables within the set must apply for the fare component being validated.

--- Chunk 563 from Cat4 - Flight Application.pdf ---
For all tables that match based on the Application/Via Indicator value ‘2” (bytes 61 or 79), all information for only those matched tables within the set must apply for the fare component being validated.

« When multiple Record 3 tables are identified with a relational indicator of OR or THEN, each table is independent of the other(s). That is, only one table applies for the fare component being validated.

When a flight number restriction is instructed without a carrier code, enter the Record 2 owning carrier code in the carrier field. For example, BA instructs that all travel must be on flight 200 or 201. ATPCO will enter that all travel must be on BA flight 200 or BA flight 201.

« When an operating carrier is instructed and the marketing carrier is not instructed, enter the Record 2 owning carrier in the corresponding marketing carrier field in Carrier/Flight Table No. 986.

Nonstop (byte 89) service restriction should not be entered in the same Record 3 table as a Geo Spec Table with a Via application (e.g. do not enter “must be via NYC on nonstop flights”).

--- Chunk 564 from Cat4 - Flight Application.pdf ---
Nonstop (byte 89) service restriction should not be entered in the same Record 3 table as a Geo Spec Table with a Via application (e.g. do not enter “must be via NYC on nonstop flights”).

« TSls should not be used to indicate a last point out/first point in application for the geographic locales. The application of the geographic locales is already defined as last point out/first point in, and use of a TSI may cause the data to pass or fail incorrectly. For example: the fare component must contain a portion of travel between US and Europe. Processing will validate the portion of travel between the last point out of the US and the first point into Europe, and vice versa. TSIs are not needed to reflect this application.

« Edits prevent entering a negative Geo Spec Table (value 0 in Byte 61 or 79) with negative flight application (negative flight number, carrier, type of service, equipment code) within the same table. If necessary to enter this type data, it must be coded in two tables.

Cat5 Advance Reservations & Ticketing

CATS ADWANCE RESERVATIONS & TICKETING

Many times Airlines mistakenly file bytes 64-67 which can lead to pricing being allowed where the Airline intended to restrict it to an Advance Purchase.

Advance Ticketing Exception Time Bytes 64-67

This field is used to indicate that the ticketing requirements are only applicable if reservations are made by the time specified. The Exception Time is a match field, and the data specified within the Record 3 table will only apply if the reservation time matches the Exception Time. Application of the Exception Time is an exception to Record 2 string processing. When the Exception Time is coded and matched (and the Override Date Table is also matched) processing must pass or fail on that table. Processing cannot read on to any other tables.

Cat6 Min Stay

CATG MIN STAY

Category 6 (Minimum Stay) specifies the earliest time travel may commence from the point specified by the To Geographic Specification Table (bytes 37-44). The From and To Geographic Specification Tables (bytes 29-36, 37-44) define the points to be used when measuring the minimum stay. Minimum stay provisions are not processed on one way pricing units. If data exists in Category 6 applicable for a one way fare that is being used on a one way pricing unit, then processing will not validate the minimum stay; however, if a one way fare is used in a round trip, open jaw, or circle trip pricing solution, then the minimum stay provisions will apply.

In order to validate Category 6, it is essential to know:

« Day/times of all flights for all fare components on the pricing unit/journey.

Assumptions

When there is no data present for Category 6:

When there is no Category 6 information (no Category 6 Record 2 that resolves to the fare), the assumption is that there are no minimum stay requirements.

When there is data present for Category 6:

--- Chunk 570 from Cat6 - Min Stay.pdf ---
When there is no Category 6 information (no Category 6 Record 2 that resolves to the fare), the assumption is that there are no minimum stay requirements.

When there is data present for Category 6:

Minimum Stay is calculated from the departure from the point specified in the From Geographic Specification Table to travel commencing from the point specified in the To Geographic Specification Table. When validating minimum stay provisions, processing must first mark the points specified in the From and To Geo Spec Tables and then calculate the minimum stay. Minimum stay will be counted from the day after departure from the point specified in the From Geo Spec Table, unless the provision is specified in months. If the provision is specified in months, then minimum stay will be counted from the day of departure from the point specified in the From Geo Spec Table.

Coding Conventions

From and To Geo Spec Tables:

--- Chunk 571 from Cat6 - Min Stay.pdf ---
Coding Conventions

From and To Geo Spec Tables:

Based on the category assumption, when the point from which the minimum stay count begins is not defined in the rule, the ‘From’ portion of travel will be entered as ‘Departure from Fare Origin’ (TSI 01). If the point from which travel may commence is not defined in the rule the ‘To’ portion will be entered as the ‘Last point of stopover’ (TSI 05). Likewise, if outward destination is not defined it will be assumed that outward destination, point of turnaround, is the last point of stopover.

Directionality:

Calculation of minimum stay is done by going outside the fare component being validated and looking at the entire pricing unit. Processing will mark the points specified in the From and To Geo Spec Tables, on

the pricing unit. The minimum stay is then counted from the departure from the point specified in the From Geo Spec Table to travel commencement from the point specified in the To Geo Spec table.

As the provision is calculated by looking at the entire pricing unit, any minimum stay restrictions based on directionality require the use of value 3 (Origin Loc 1) or value 4 (Origin Loc 2). Use of directionality value (From Loc 1), value 2 (To Loc 1), Inbound or Outbound is illogical.

Cat7 Max Stay

CAT? MAX STAY

The Maximum Stay Category (Category 7) provides the capability to indicate the last time at which travel must commence or must be completed from the point specified by the To Geographic Specification Table (bytes 33-40). Calculation of this date may be based on travel commencement or ticket issuance, and the maximum stay may be stated as either a day of week or elapsed time. Maximum stay provisions are not processed on one way pricing units. If data exists in Category 7 applicable for a one way fare that is being used on a one way pricing unit, then processing will not validate the maximum stay; however, if a one way fare is used in a round trip, open jaw, or circle trip pricing solution, then the maximum stay provisions will apply. If this category is not present there are no maximum stay requirements, outside of the ticket validity applicable to the fare.

In order to validate the Maximum Stay Category, it is essential to know the following:

« Days and Times of all flights for all fare components on the pricing unit and journey.

« Date of Ticket Issuance.

Category 8 Stopovers defines the conditions when a stopover(s) is permitted or required within the fare component or pricing unit and the applicable charges, carriers, and locations associated with those stopovers.

In order to validate this category it is mandatory to know the following:

¢ All intermediate ticketed points on the pricing unit encompassing the fare component being validated

¢ All fare components and fare break points on the pricing unit encompassing the fare component being validated.

« The amount of elapsed time at each intermediate ticketed point on the fare component

¢ All marketing carriers providing transportation on each fare component in the pricing unit being validated

The type of pricing solution in which the fare component is being priced (e.g. open jaw, round trip, circle trip).

Embedded surface sectors on each fare component in the pricing unit being validated

Whether the fare component being processed is used outbound or inbound on the pricing unit

« The Stopover Time conditions of all fare components on the pricing unit

« The type of passenger for whom the fare is being priced

Term Definition Connection An intermediate ticketed point within the fare component at which the calculated elapsed time the period between the scheduled local times of arrival and departure is less than the time period which defines a stopover. A connection is always a transfer. NOTE: For the purposes of Category 8 validation, a connection is defined based on the data in the Time MIN fields (bytes 52-55). Gateway Refer to Glossary of Terms Stopover An intermediate ticketed point within the fare component at which the calculated elapsed time the period between the scheduled local times of arrival and departure is greater than the time period defined in a carrier's tariff as a stopover (4 hours for the ATPCO Domestic Fare Product and 24 hours for the ATPCO International Fare Product). A stopover is always a transfer. NOTE: For the purposes of Category 8 validation, a stopover is defined based on the data in the Time MIN fields (bytes 52-55). Transfer An intermediate ticketed point. A transfer is either a stopover or a connection.

When there is no data present for Category 8:

In the absence of Category 8 (no Category 8 Record 2 that resolves to the fare or no Category 8 Record 3 is applicable within the string) the system assumption is that stopovers are not permitted at any point on the fare component being validated.

When processing resolves to an applicable Category 8 Record 3 that permits/requires stopovers, stopovers may occur at any point on the fare component/pricing unit (depending upon the presence or absence of data in the MAX field (bytes 16-17) with no geographic or carrier restrictions unless otherwise specified. No charges will be assessed unless otherwise specified. Additionally, stopovers at embedded surface sectors are permitted provided both end points of the surface sector are permitted (i.e. based on Recurring Segment data); an embedded surface sector only counts as 1 stopover. A stopover is defined as an interruption of travel greater than 4 hours for the ATPCO Domestic Fare Product data and greater than 24 hours for the ATPCO International Fare Product data, unless otherwise specified in the Category Time Fields (bytes 52-59).

Fare break points are never considered stopover points for the purposes of processing Category 8 data.

Processing Steps THEN/AND Subset

--- Chunk 582 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
Fare break points are never considered stopover points for the purposes of processing Category 8 data.

Processing Steps THEN/AND Subset

In a THEN/AND subset, processing will calculate the total sum of the required/permitted number of stopovers across all matched tables in the set based on the MIN (bytes 14-15), MAX (bytes 16-17), Out (bytes 18-19), and IN (bytes 20-21) fields. The basic processing steps are:

1. Attempt to match the first Category 8 Record 3 table (THEN table) for the fare component being validated.

2. Determine if any AND tables exist in the subset, and attempt to match the AND tables. If the fare component being validated does not match to any tables in the subset, continue to the next subset:

¢ lf amatch is not made to another subset; or

« Ifamatch is made to another subset but processing cannot validate all stopovers against the matched subset; or

« Ifno other subsets exist, then Apply the system assumption for this level (stopovers are not permitted on the fare component being validated)

--- Chunk 583 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
« Ifno other subsets exist, then Apply the system assumption for this level (stopovers are not permitted on the fare component being validated)

3. Calculate the sum of the MIN (bytes 14-15), MAX (bytes 16-17), OUT (bytes 18-19), and IN (bytes 20-21) number of stopovers for all matched tables in the subset. In other words, calculate:

« The sum of the MIN number of stopovers for all matched tables in the subset to determine the total MIN number of stopovers required; and

The sum of the MAX number of stopovers for all matched tables in the subset to determine the total MAX number of stopovers permitted; and

6. Continue validation of the permitted/required stopovers using Recurring Segment data in the matched tables according to fare component or pricing unit scope defined by the Recurring Segment (and the presence or absence of data in the MAX field).

« Recurring segment stopover data must remain within the confines of the MAX, OUT, IN numbers specifications of the table housing that specific Recurring Segment being processed.

Recurring segments specifying a “required” condition must be validated and passed prior to attempting to validate and pass other Recurring Segments.

« For any stopovers that do not pass validation against the THEN table, continue processing to an AND table and attempt to validate them against the AND table. All stopovers on the fare component or pricing unit do not have to pass validation against the same Category 8 Record 3 table, but all must pass validation against the same THEN/AND subset.

--- Chunk 586 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
7. For any matched and passed Category 8 Record 3, apply any applicable stopovers charges. All stopovers must pass validation against the THEN/AND subset in order to pass Category 8 processing.

Pricing Unit vs. Fare Component Application

Category 8 allows for the data to be determined as applying to the entire pricing unit or to a single fare component based on the presence or absence of data in the MAX field (bytes 16-17) as described below:

* If MAX (bytes 16-17) contains any value other than Blank, then all data in the Category 8 Record 3 has a pricing unit application unless otherwise specified by the application of an individual field.

* If MAX (bytes 16-17) is value Blank and OUT (bytes 18-19) and/or IN (bytes 20-21) contain data (i.e. contain any value other than Blank), then all data in the Category 8 Record 3 has a fare component application.

--- Chunk 587 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
* If MAX (bytes 16-17) is value Blank and OUT (bytes 18-19) and/or IN (bytes 20-21) contain data (i.e. contain any value other than Blank), then all data in the Category 8 Record 3 has a fare component application.

NOTE: Edits only permit value Blank in MAX, Out, and In fields when the table only contains Text Table 996 only (Unavailable Data Tag byte 138 value Y). In this case processing ignores the table and continues to another table, attempting to find a match and pass. If no other tables exist or are matched, apply the system assumption for this level (no stopovers permitted on the fare component being validated).

Pricing Unit Table with Fare Component Data

--- Chunk 588 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
Pricing Unit Table with Fare Component Data

A single Record 3 table can have data in MAX (bytes 16-17) as well as in the OUT (bytes 18-19) and/or IN (bytes 20-21) fields. In this case, the table has a pricing unit application (based on presence of data in the MAX field); however, data in the Out and In fields are always applied to the fare component only (depending upon the outbound or inbound application of the fare component), even when used in a pricing unit table. Likewise, when MAX (bytes 16-17) contains data, the Recurring Segment data applies to the pricing unit, unless the segment contains value O (Outbound) or | (Inbound) in the I/O Indicator field (byte 163) . When the I/O indicator is set to value O or I, then the data in that Recurring Segment are always applied to the fare component only (depending upon the outbound or inbound application of the fare component), even when used in a pricing unit table. [Refer to later sections of this document regarding the application of the Out/In fields (bytes 18-21) and the I/O indicator (byte 163).]

NOTE: The pricing unit vs. fare component application of each individual field is detailed in Section 4.1 of this document.

Fare Component Table with Pricing Unit Data

A single Record 3 table with MAX (bytes 16-17) value Blank and data in the OUT (bytes 18-19) and/or IN (bytes 20-21) fields has a fare component application. In this case, data in the Recurring Segment has a fare component application. If a Recurring Segment has I/O Indicator (byte 163) value E (Either Outbound or Inbound but not both), then processing ignores this Recurring Segment since value E requires a pricing unit application. In this case, stopovers must be validated based on any other Recurring Segments. If no

Mixture of Pricing Unit and Fare Component Data within a Single THEN/AND Subset

Subset

All of the data tables in a THEN/AND subset should have the same processing application, either pricing unit or fare component as determined by the MAX or Out/In fields. If a THEN/AND set contains a mixture of pricing unit and fare component tables, then processing ignores the entire set and continues to the next set. If no further subsets exist or are matched, then apply the system assumption (stopovers are not permitted on the fare component being validated).

--- Chunk 591 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
When a Category 8 Record 3 table within a THEN/AND subset contains Text Table 996 only (Unavailable Data Tag byte 138 value Y), the table is ignored and has no automated application when processing the subset. For automated processing, the THEN/AND subset is processed as if this table (containing Text Table 996 only) does not exist. A table with Unavailable Data Tag byte 138 value Y (Text Table 996 only) can be present as part of a THEN/AND subset where the application of the subset is either pricing unit or fare component (based on data in MAX and OUT/IN fields).

Mixture of Pricing Unit and Fare Component Data across Fare Components in a Single Pricing Unit

Single Pricing Unit

When multiple fare components are combined in a single pricing unit:

« If all fare components resolve to applicable Category 8 data relevant to the pricing unit (i.e. MAX bytes 16-17 contains data for all applicable Category 8 Record 3s), then the Category 8 data for all fare components is validated against the pricing unit.

--- Chunk 592 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
If at least one fare component resolves to Category 8 data applicable to the pricing unit (i.e. MAX bytes 16-17 contains data) and at least one fare component resolves to Category 8 data applicable to the fare component (i.e. MAX bytes 16-17 is value Blank and Out bytes 18-19 and/or In bytes 20-21 contain data), then the Category 8 data applicable to the pricing unit validates against the entire pricing unit and the Category 8 data applicable to the fare component validates against the fare component that resolved to the data. (Refer to the example below.)

THEN/AND subsets

All of the data tables in a THEN/AND subset should have the same processing application, either pricing unit or fare component

« If MAX (bytes 16-17) contains data in one table in the subset, then all tables in the subset must contain data in MAX.

« If MAX (bytes 16-17) is Blank in one table in the subset, then all tables in the subset must have MAX value Blank..

All of the data tables in a THEN/AND subset should have the same Time data in the TIME MIN and TIME MAX fields

« Do NOT code both positive and negative provisions for the exact same locale unless the Charge (byte 164) values differ.

• The sum of the Number (bytes 143-144) value across all Recurring Segments within the table must be greater than or equal to the MAX value (Bytes 16-17) when MAX is present. When MAX is Blank, then the sum must be greater than or equal the higher of the OUT (bytes 18-19) or IN (bytes 20-21) values.

• Ifthe Maximum number of stopovers is restricted to a specified number Outbound and a specified number Inbound, the Out and In fields in the fixed portion of the record (bytes 18-19, 20-21) must be coded to express this. The I/O field in the Recurring Segment (byte 163) should only be used to define the outbound or inbound portion to which the Recurring Segment data applies.

4.1.15.6 Inbound/Outbound (byte 163)

This field specifies the application of the data in the Recurring Segment based on whether the fare component is used Inbound or Outbound. Following is an explanation of applicable values:

Value I: Inbound. The data in the Recurring Segment applies to the fare component being validated when the fare is used inbound. If the fare is used outbound, then the Recurring Segment is not applicable.

Value O: Outbound. The data in the Recurring Segment applies to the fare component being validated when the fare is used outbound. If the fare is used inbound, then the Recurring Segment is not applicable.

--- Chunk 598 from Cat8 - Stopovers.pdf ---
Value O: Outbound. The data in the Recurring Segment applies to the fare component being validated when the fare is used outbound. If the fare is used inbound, then the Recurring Segment is not applicable.

Value E: Either Outbound or Inbound But Not Both. The data in the Recurring Segment applies to the pricing unit encompassing the fare component being validated. The stopover condition specified in the Recurring Segment is only permitted outbound or inbound, but not both. If the stopover being validated meets the conditions in the Recurring Segment, then processing must look at fare components in the opposite direction of travel to validate that the same stopover condition is not present. If the Recurring Segment condition is met both outbound and inbound, then processing will fail the Recurring Segment and continue to another Recurring Segment with a different Charge value (byte 164) or to another table in the subset.

--- Chunk 600 from Cat9 - Transfers.pdf ---
Cat9 Transfers

CATS TRANSFERS

Category 9 defines the provisions for application of Transfers on a pricing unit or fare component. In the absence of Category 9 data, the system assumption is that unlimited transfers are permitted on the pricing unit Embedded surface sectors are permitted, International fare break surface sectors are permitted and USCA (any USCA Domestic tariff) Fare Break surface sectors are not permitted. Fare break surface sectors are not permitted at journey origins.

Assumptions

In the absence of a Record 2 that resolves to a fare, or when a match is not made to any Record 3 tables within a string, then the system assumption applies as follows: • Unlimited transfers are permitted on the pricing unit

In the absence of a Record 2 that resolves to a fare, or when a match is not made to any Record 3 tables within a string, then the system assumption applies as follows:

« Embedded surface sectors are permitted between any points

« International fare break surface sectors are permitted

USCA (any USCA Domestic tariff) fare break surface sectors are not permitted.

« Fare break surface sectors are not permitted at journey origins

THEN/AND table data

--- Chunk 601 from Cat9 - Transfers.pdf ---
USCA (any USCA Domestic tariff) fare break surface sectors are not permitted.

« Fare break surface sectors are not permitted at journey origins

THEN/AND table data

THEN/AND subsets should not have tables with mixed application. If a THEN table contains a MAX value, every subsequent table should also contain a MAX value. Additionally, if the THEN table contains only an OUT/IN value, then any subsequent AND table should NOT contain a MAX value. If a GDS/CRS receives a subset containing mixed application for Category 9, they should ignore processing, apply the system assumption (or another processing level — general rule or fare rule — that can be applied) and contact the carrier.

Processing Steps THEN/AND

= . Match to the first Category 9 Record 3 table (THEN table) for the fare component being validated.

2. Determine if any AND tables exist in the subset, and attempt to match the AND tables.

3. Calculate the sum of the MIN, MAX, OUT, IN number of transfers for all matched tables in the subset.

4. Determine if data should be measured against the pricing unit or the fare component, based on the absence of a value in the MAX field.

--- Chunk 602 from Cat9 - Transfers.pdf ---
4. Determine if data should be measured against the pricing unit or the fare component, based on the absence of a value in the MAX field.

5. Validate the MIN, MAX, OUT, IN number of transfers (calculated in step 3 above) against the pricing solution. If the MAX field(s) contains a ‘blank’ value, validate all transfers data against the fare component being validated. If the MAX field contains a value other than ‘blank’ validate all transfers data against the entire pricing unit. Tables that are fare component in application (as defined by the absence of data in the MAX field) may only be used to validate transfers on the fare component

being processed. Tables that are pricing unit in application (as defined by the presence of data in the MAX field) may be used to validate transfers on the fare component being processed as well as the pricing unit containing the fare component being processed. NOTE: fare component vs. pricing unit application will be discussed later in this document where the O/I indicator is presented.

--- Chunk 603 from Cat9 - Transfers.pdf ---
6. Continue validation of the transfers using recurring segment data in the matched tables according to fare component or pricing unit scope as outlined in step 5. Recurring segment transfer data must remain within the confines of the MIN, MAX, OUT, IN of the table housing that recurring segment being processed.

7. Apply any applicable charges.

Processing Steps THEN/OR

1. Match to the first category 9 record 3 table (THEN table)

a. Validate the MIN, MAX, OUT, IN number of transfers on the fare component or pricing unit as defined by the data. Continue to validate the transfers using recurring segment data

b. If any of the transfers cannot be validated continue processing to the next OR table or next set. If another table or set is not found that can be used to validate the transfers, the fare fails pricing.

2. If the fare being validated does not match to the THEN table, continue to the next OR table or set. If another table or set is not found that matches or if no other tables exist, apply the system assumption for this level: unlimited transfers allowed; surface permitted, other than for USCA Fare Break surface.

3. Apply transfer charges.

--- Chunk 604 from Cat9 - Transfers.pdf ---
3. Apply transfer charges.

Category 9 allows for the data to be determined as applying to the entire pricing unit or to a single fare component. If there is a positive value in the MAX field, the entire table is considered to have a pricing unit application. If the MAX does not contain any value (‘blank’) and there is a positive value in either/both the OUTIIN fields, the table is considered to have a fare component application. NOTE: the only way a table will not have a value in either MAX or OUT/IN is if the entire table contains Surface Tags and/or Text Table 996 only.

All of the data tables in an AND set should have the same processing application, either pricing unit or fare component as determined by the MAX or OUT/IN fields. If any table in an AND set states a fare component application and the remainder of the set contains pricing unit tables; the GDS should ignore the entire set. If any table in an AND set states a pricing unit application and the remainder

--- Chunk 605 from Cat9 - Transfers.pdf ---
of the set contains fare component tables; the GDS should ignore the entire set. When a set is ignored, a subsequent set should still be interrogated for purposes of autopricing. If there are no additional sets, apply the system assumption.

For a THEN/OR set where

1) the tables in the set have mixed application and

2) the THEN table is Pricing Unit and

3) the OR table is Fare Component and

4) a FAIL condition is reached on the THEN table

Processing should use the OR table for the Fare Component being validated and the THEN tables (granted they pass) for all subsequent fare components in the pricing unit. Additionally, in 2+ component pricing units any fare components validated previously in the solution as Pricing Unit must be revalidated as Fare Component should the THEN table fail.

CHILD & INFANT PRICING

The Discount Categories (Categories 19-22) are used for creating a discounted fare within a single category. The creation occurs by either using a specific discounted fare amount or the information for calculating a discounted fare, as defined in a rule for a designated passenger type. All of the criteria are follows:

« type of passenger and age

• fare on which to base the calculation

« amount or percent to be charged

« specifics of the resulting/calculated fare

* accompanying travel requirements

If the category is not present or there are no provisions applicable to the given fare, either in the footnote, fare rule or general rule, then a discount does not apply to the fare being validated.

Definitions

Base Fare : The fare from which a discount will be calculated in order to determine the created discounted fare.

Created Fare : The resulting fare that is determined after a discount is calculated from a base fare or a specified amount is applied.

Validated Fare : The published fare that is being processed against the Record 2 and 3 in order to determine if a discount is applicable.

Assumptions

--- Chunk 607 from Child & Infant Pricing.pdf ---
Validated Fare : The published fare that is being processed against the Record 2 and 3 in order to determine if a discount is applicable.

Assumptions

In the absence of Category 19-22 (Record 2 for Category 19-22 does not exist or no Record 3 is applicable at the fare rule, footnote or general rule level), the system assumption for the Discount Categories is that there are no discounts for the validated fare.

Once Categories 19-22 are matched, the assumption is that the data is applied by fare component.

Base Fare

The Base Fare Fields are used to calculate a discounted fare (see excerpt from ATP Data Apps below).

These fields are used to calculate a discounted fare and are usually only used if the base fare is different from the fare being validated.

The Commission fields consist of the following data elements:

* Gross/Net Indicator (byte 34)

* Percentage (bytes 35-41)

«Amount 1 and Amount 2 (bytes 42-63)

These data elements are further defined below.

Gross/Net Indicator (byte 34)

The Gross/Net Indicator identifies whether a calculated commission specified in Percent field (bytes 3541) or a standard commission is based on the Net Submit Fare amount or on the Gross (Ticketed) Fare amount or whether the commission is the percentage difference between the Net Submit Fare amount and the Gross Fare amount. Data in this field is used to determine the Commission Type (COTP) for BSP reporting.

Applicable values in byte 34 follow:

Value N = Net Amount. Calculated commission or standard commission is based on the net fare amount.

Value G = Gross (Ticketed) Amount. Calculated commission or standard commission is based on the gross (ticketed) amount.

Value B = Calculate the percentage difference between the Net Fare amount and the Ticketed (Gross) Fare amount.

--- Chunk 611 from Commission.pdf ---
Value B = Calculate the percentage difference between the Net Fare amount and the Ticketed (Gross) Fare amount.

Value Blank =No Application. Standard commission applies, including agent input of commission.

Commission Conflict Fare Quote Warning Message for Travelport+ only

When there are different commission amounts for private fares or a combination of private and public fares on the same ticket, Travelport+ (Galileo) will issue a warning message at the time of pricing to encourage the user to manually add a commission amount.

Hence, we recommend the user to use the TMU1Z entry to manually add the commission; otherwise, the default airline commission rate will apply.

This warning message is COMMISSION: MANUAL INPUT NEEDED BEFORE TICKETING

Public no commission = commission conflict which is why the WARNING is returned for the agent to input the commission manually.

Exception to this logic:

The 200CT23, via PRICING-1445 enhancement, we eliminate the warning & commission override function when public fares, cat15 private fares, or cat35 private fares with no ATPCO commission filed (regardless of what is coded in the airline commission table CGCTD) are combined with cat35 fares with 0% commission coded. In this scenario 0% commission is applied to the whole itinerary priced/ticket. The commission cannot be altered anymore as this is not considered as a commission conflict. If you try to manually add the commission you will get below error message:

Ex: Refund within 12 months of issuance or refund within 12 month is original travel date. If airline can designate if the error is related to issue date vs. travel date, that would assist the agency in resolution and also for tracking purposes.

FAQ’s

Q1: What happens when there are multiple violations for a ticket?

The airlines agreed that the largest dollar value violation will be the primary. Typically if there is a fare rule violation/error, that type of error will be the primary violation.

Example:

Ticket #1231234564561 has a fare rule violation of $325.00, a tax violation of $62.00 and the airline is also assessing a fee of $25.00 for total debit memo value of $412.00.

The airline will most likely select a fare rule violation reason code for this example.

Q2: _ A2:

--- Chunk 675 from debitmemo_Reasons.pdf ---
The airline will most likely select a fare rule violation reason code for this example.

Q2: _ A2:

If there are multiple fare rule violations, will the airline always select #46 — Multiple Fare Rule Violations? We will encourage carriers to utilize #46 — Multiple Fare Rule Violations for cases where there is more than one fare rule violation, however, some carriers may select only the primary fare rule violation as the debit memo reason.

Example:

Ticket #1231234564562 totaling $1,140.00 has three fare rule violations;

1. A day/time error resulting in an additional $140.00 due

2. An advance reservation error resulting in an additional $800.00 due

3. A maximum stay error resulting in an additional $200.00 due

The airline may select #21 — Advance Reservations and Restrictions — Category 5 fare rule violation as the debit memo reason code since that error had the highest amount due.

. Refund of a ticket that no longer has value. 1. Non refundable rules are filed through category 31 (automated). Category 16 is for text only. 2. Carrier should indicate which category when issuing the debit memo. 1. Carrier's policies differ — expiration can be based on travel date or issue date. Ex: Refund within 12 months of issuance or refund within 12 month is original travel date. If carrier can designate if the error is related to issue date vs. travel date, that would assist the agency in resolution and also for tracking purposes. Category 33 provides a way to automate refund provisions by defining who does the refund apply to, when it can place, conditions to be met for the refund, charges, etc. See ATPCO Fare Filing Category description for further definitions. 1. This applies to situations where a ticket was originally refundable but was not cancelled prior to flight, so the ticket is no longer refundable.

FAQ’s

Q1: What happens when there are multiple violations for a ticket?

The airlines agreed that the largest dollar value violation will be the primary. Typically if there is a fare rule violation/error, that type of error will be the primary violation.

Example:

Ticket #1231234564561 has a fare rule violation of $325.00, a tax violation of $62.00 and the carrier is also assessing a fee of $25.00 for total debit memo value of $412.00.

The carrier will most likely select a fare rule violation reason code for this example.

Q2: A2:

--- Chunk 733 from dmreasoncodes.pdf ---
The carrier will most likely select a fare rule violation reason code for this example.

Q2: A2:

If there are multiple fare rule violations, will the carrier always select #46 — Multiple Fare Rule Violations? We will encourage carriers to utilize #46 — Multiple Fare Rule Violations for cases where there is more than one fare rule violation, however, some carriers may select only the primary fare rule violation as the debit memoreason.

Example:

Ticket #1231234564562 totaling $1,140.00 has three fare rule violations;

1. A day/time error resulting in an additional $140.00 due

2. An advance reservation error resulting in an additional $800.00 due

3. A maximum stay error resulting in an additional $200.00 due

The carrier may select #21 — Advance Reservations and Restrictions — Category 5 fare rule violation as the debit memo reason code since that error had the highest amount due.

Fare Selection Criteria will consider up to two potential carrier’s fares for a fare component. The carrier’s fare that will be selected for the fare component will be the lower of the two fares based on a comparison between Options 1 and 2 below, assuming each fare passes all rules.

* Option 1 for fare selection: Most significant carrier (carrier used in the current fare selection process).

1. The first sector crossing from one Area to another Area, if none then

2. The first sector crossing from one sub-area to another, if none then

3. The first international sector

* Option 2 for fare selection: The carrier that provides air travel for the longest measured TPMs (Ticketed Point Miles)

1. The longest international sector, OR

2. The longest consecutive international sectors, OR

3. The longest consecutive international and domestic sectors.

Fare Selection

When a carrier is selected to be the fare owning carrier for the fare component, that carrier is then considered to be “primary” carrier on the Fare Component for the purposes of RBD (Reservation Booking Designators) and Transfers — Category 9.

The fare for the carrier selected to be used on the Fare Component must pass all fare rules (e.g. routing/mileage, stopovers, transfers, surcharges, combinations, RBDs, etc.).

Determining the Fare Owning Carrier on a Fare Quote

After pricing the itinerary, the agent will be able to determine the carrier that was selected to be the fare owning carrier on each fare component using a follow-on entry.

Account Codes

ACCOUNT CODES

An Account Code is an alphanumeric code used to secure a private fare to a specific account. This can be up to 20 characters long must be alphanumeric.

We do not support numeric only or any code starting with a number. For example, A12345 would be supported 12345A would not.

How to ensure the account code appears on a Fare

Display

When an account code is filed as a THEN Category 1 it will display following the applicable fare.

With the exception of Category 25, an account code filed in an IF Category 1 is not displayed on the fare display but is required to be input for pricing.

If the account code differs by GDS, specific agencies or any other security type Category 15 can be used as a qualifying category.

Example

Data

THEN Category 01 PTC ADT account code APOLLO

IF Category 15 CRS 1V

THEN Category 01 PTC PFA account code GALILEO

IF Category 15 CRS 1G

THEN Category 01 PTC PFA account code WORLDSPAN

IF Category 15 CRS 1P

Do not code the same account code twice as IF 001 tables

Here is an example of wrong filing since having the same account code coded twice:

--- Chunk 758 from lattttttttt.pdf ---

IF Category 15 CRS 1P

Do not code the same account code twice as IF 001 tables

As per ATPCO stringing logic, once a GDS match a table, we should stop processing.

As per ATPCO, if you file ADT, only ADT passenger will quote. So with such coding, children and infant discounts are NOT being applied.

DATA APPLICATION FOR CATEGORY 1 ELIGIBILITY

4.1 Application of Data for Eligibility Processing

4.1.1 Passenger Type (Bytes 14-16)

Data in this field consists of a code that identifies the type of passenger who is eligible for the fare. Processing will match data in this field against the Passenger Type Code (PTC) in the Record 1 segment in order to determine if additional eligibility requirements exist for the Record 1 PTC (see paragraph below regarding how to match the PTC). When a match is made to the PTC in this field and the data in the Override Date Table is also matched, the remaining Category 1 Record 3 data must be applied. When a match is not made to the PTC in Bytes 14-16 or to the Override Date Table, processing will read on to the OR Table, AND Table, or next set. If no further tables (or no match to any other table), apply the assumption of no further eligibility requirements or restrictions.

To successfully match the Category 1 PTC, the following conditions must apply:

» Any PTC in Record 1 (or Record 8 for Fare By Rule) will match to a value of Blank 1 in the PTC in Category 1

‘ord ul: b

other than 19-22 (when PTCi is not Blank).

--- Chunk 761 from lattttttttt.pdf ---
» Any PTC in Record 1 (or Record 8 for Fare By Rule) will match to a value of Blank 1 in the PTC in Category 1

‘ord ul: b

other than 19-22 (when PTCi is not Blank).

A pricing query with no PTC entered will be assumed to have an ADT passenger type. A Blank PTC value in Record 1 will be assumed to have a passenger type of ADT for matching purposes with Category 1.

MASTER ACCOUNT CODES

Master account codes allow you to group together multiple account codes (a maximum of 10) under a single "master" account code.

For example, an agency has created fares using account codes SO and IT.

They have a master account code called ALL, which contains account codes SO and IT.

LUFTHANSA GROUP Lufthansa Group Airlines Agency Debit Memo Policy

1 Introduction

Dear Travel Agent Partner,

This document shall provide you with an overview of Policies and Procedures applicable to ADMs (Agent Debit memos) issued for the Lufthansa Group airlines (LH/Lufthansa German Airlines, LX/Swiss International Airlines, OS/Austrian Airlines, SN/Brussels Airlines), in accordance with the IATA Resolution 850m (Passenger Agency Resolutions Manual).

ADMs will be issued in compliance with tariffs, rules, general conditions of carriage and other instructions provided by the Lufthansa Group airlines, IATA and Computer Reservation Systems (CRS).

--- Chunk 764 from LHG_ADM_Policy_2022-03-01.pdf ---
ADMs will be issued in compliance with tariffs, rules, general conditions of carriage and other instructions provided by the Lufthansa Group airlines, IATA and Computer Reservation Systems (CRS).

ADMs are a legitimate accounting tool for use by all BSP Airlines and are used to collect amounts or make adjustments to agent transactions in respect of the issuance and use of Traffic Documents issued by the Agent, such as fares, taxes, commission, refund, re-issue or similar.

ADMs may also be issued for adjustment of transactions concerning reservations, no-shows and for administration fees.

2 ADM Policy and Procedures

coo Wherever possible, Lufthansa Group airlines will provide ADMs through BSP link on a daily basis. In general, a PDF-file will be attached to the ADM, where each individual position of the ADM is described in detail. It is recommended to store and use this document as reference for any further action, since it contains additional relevant information not shown in the BSP link own format.

--- Chunk 765 from LHG_ADM_Policy_2022-03-01.pdf ---
coo Any ADM position relates to a specific transaction. Lufthansa Group airlines ADMs may be issued for a maximum number of 99 individual positions (document numbers). For each position detailed information will be provided on the PDF-document in BSP link.

coo When more than one ADM is raised in relation to the same ticket, the reason for each adjustment will be specified.

oo Lufthansa Group airlines will always provide on an ADM the name of a contact person (usually originator of the ADM) and/or department with phone number and/or E-Mail address on any ADM.

coo ©6An administration fee will be levied for every ADM, irrespective of the number of positions included in the ADM. This ADM-fee is part of the

LUFTHANSA GROUP Lufthansa Group Airlines Agency Debit Memo Policy

ADM. Kindly contact your local Lufthansa Group airlines counterpart for information regarding the amount charged in your country in local currency.

LUFTHANSA GROUP Lufthansa Group Airlines Agency Debit Memo Policy

ADM. Kindly contact your local Lufthansa Group airlines counterpart for information regarding the amount charged in your country in local currency.

oo Lufthansa Group airlines will raise ADMs only when the total value exceeds EUR 10.00 (for a single ADM). However, exceptions to this may apply, for example (not limited to) for correction of taxes, international surcharges or errors in application/deduction of commission.

co In general, ADMs are issued for ticket related transactions, including reservations transactions prior to ticket issuance as well as ticket usage.

coo ADMs for Reservation Manipulations are created in accordance to IATA Resolution 830a. The respective Compensation Fee can be found in the attachment to this Policy (please see last page).

--- Chunk 767 from LHG_ADM_Policy_2022-03-01.pdf ---
coo ADMs for Reservation Manipulations are created in accordance to IATA Resolution 830a. The respective Compensation Fee can be found in the attachment to this Policy (please see last page).

oo Lufthansa Group airlines may issue ADMs also beyond the 9 month after ast travel date stated in Reso 850m, provided the claim has not statutebarred, as this represents the most efficient procedure for both, Travel Agent and Airlines. In case of disagreement to an ADM, the Travel Agent can provide eventual rejection within 15 days through BSP link. The billing is then processed outside BSP through an invoice.

coo Lufthansa Group airlines do accept the justified rejection (dispute) against an ADM in accordance with IATA-Resolution 850m. Disputes must always be processed through BSP-link within 15 days after ADM has been posted.

coo In case of ADM dispute, the clarification takes place within a maximum of 30 days.

co In case of voluntarily closed Travel Agencies (e.g. subsidiaries), Lufthansa Group airlines will issue ADMs to the respective Head Offices or other Branch Offices, in case known to the Airline. Otherwise, an invoice will be sent to the closed Agency.

--- Chunk 768 from LHG_ADM_Policy_2022-03-01.pdf ---
oo Lufthansa Group airlines reserve the right to amend or change these ADM policies at any time. Agents will be informed in advance of any such changes.

Net Ticket Data (NTD)

NET TICKET DATA (NTD)

NTD Not Visible

When private fares are quoted, only the quoting agency will be allowed to display the NET TICKET DATA, no matter if the other agency trying to see NET TICKET DATA is group coded or not, UNLESS

1. The agency quoting the fare add the ticketing agency in the fare quote format :

FQTAXXX (XXX being the PCC of the issuing agency. TA means : ticketing agency). The quoting agency will still be able to display the NET DATA as well, but if it’s also a IATA agency, they will not be able to issue the ticket anymore, and will receive an error msg at time of ticketing.

2. The agency has no IATA number, and always (or mainly) has the same ticketing agency : the AAT field ‘TKAG’ may be updated with the PCC of the agency issuing tickets, so that the default would be to quote with this ticketing agency. Here for instance, 1BT could be added to the AAT of 7E5X in the TKAG field if 1BT always issue tickets for 7E5X.

3. The NGGF field in the AAT Table controls whether NTD is on/off

Net Ticket Data Conflict

--- Chunk 770 from Net Ticket Data (NTD).pdf ---
3. The NGGF field in the AAT Table controls whether NTD is on/off

Net Ticket Data Conflict

This is returned when attempting to combine two fares that have conflicting ticketing instructions for masking the fare, eg IT and BT Since it can only be one or the other, the fare fails to quote.

RBD Booking Class (Record 6)

Travelport 360 Fares is compliant with ATPCO RBD Record 6 Data application

RBD data may be included within Record 1, Record 6, Categories 19-22, and Category 25.

Per ATPCO’s RBD data application, if no secondary carrier exceptions are filed either by concurrence the primary carrier’s Record 6, Convention 2 data, or by the carrier themselves in the Record 6 Convention 1 data, Travelport 360 Fares will not make any assumptions and fare quote will fail.

We are aware that some other GDS are allowing the Primary Booking Class to be used for pricing even no data is filed in Record 6, however this is not in compliance with ATPCO.

If any RBD data is missing the itinerary will fail to price as per the following ATPCO Processing diagram below.

ATPCO CATEGORY 25 FARE BY RULE RED VALIDATION

See Cat25 page here

ATP RBD TABLE 999 DUAL INVENTORY

ATPCO has enhanced RBD Table 999 with two new restriction tag values which will allow carriers to file and data providers to indicate that a Permitted or Required RBD is valid only when another specified RBD is available for sale on the same flights.

When carriers file using one of two new dual inventory restriction tags, inventory of a RBD other than the booking RBD will need to be available to qualify for the fare.

ATPCO RBD Table 999 now has two new restriction tag values:

¢ Value B If RBD 1 is available, then RBD 2 is permitted

¢ Value D If RBD 1 is available, then RBD 2 is required

These values will allow a ‘permitted’ or ‘required’ RBD to be valid only when another specified RBD is available for sale on the same flight.

Note these new restriction tags are only applicable to the Table 999 in the Fare Class Application (Record 1) and in Record 6 Convention 2 (Chart 1). ATPCO system edits will prohibit access to them within Chart in Fare By Rule (Category 25) and Record 6 Convention 1 (Chart 2).

https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/FaresAndPricing/Content/Booking Class RBD (Record 6).htm

RBD Booking Class (Record 6)

What this means is that the RBD shown in the Fare Display data (eg. FDC*1) will show the Primary RBD and any secondary RBD filed in the Chart 1 but the ability to price may be dependant on whether another specified RBD is available at time of pricing.

Example:

>FDC*1 @@1 SEANYC 29MAY24 UA USD 128.37 KAA2AQBN STAY---/-BK-N FARE CLS EXPLANATION BOOK CODES KAA2AQBN ECONOMY OW UNBUNDLED FARES KAA2AQBN APPLIES FOR ONE WAY FARES KAA2AQBN FOR ADULT BOOKING CODE EXCEPTIONS VIA UA K/N REQUIRED N WHEN K AVAILABLE

As you can see here the RBD is T class on the LON-HKG-LON however when we try to price we fail RBD.

When this occurs the carrier has stipulated that another class of service has to be available (N) in order for this fare to be quoted in its required class of service (T). When you look at the base fare table, the base fare is a ‘N-’ fare and the booking code is N* that asterisk means that N class has to be available for the TKXNCGB fare to be quote in T class.

You can verify this in ATPCO cat25 as follows

--- Chunk 799 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
How Are User Sessions Managed?

User sessions are managed using monosign functionality that prevents you from logging on to more than one session at the same time. Monosign is activated at user level.

If you try to log on to a second session using the same login credentials, you are notified that you are already logged in and the pre-existing session is highlighted. You can then choose to enter different login credentials, or you can choose to force your sign in. If you force your sign in, the pre-existing session will be automatically closed with notification and you will be signed in to your new session.

Note: Any unsaved work will be lost in the pre-existing session if you force your sign in to anew session.

What Is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (TFA) is an additional security factor for signing in. TFA is used to validate that you have access to the same email address or mobile number that is registered in the system.

After you enter your main credentials on the Welcome page, you must then enter a one-time password that was sent to your email address or mobile number. This registers the browser that you are using.

What Is Digital DNA?

Digital DNA (DDNA) is a type of two-factor authentication based on the device (computer, mobile, and so on) that you use. The authentication works through the registration of your device in Amadeus Logon and Security Server (LSS), anda browser plugin (or extension).

What Is DDNA Self-Registration?

DDNA self-registration allows you to register a device to your Selling Platform Connect login without requiring the office administrator to access this device.

If your device is not already registered, you will be prompted to request a one-time password when signing in. A password is then sent to your office administrator, who should forward this to you.

You enter this password and then sign in as usual. The device is then registered with your login credentials for future sessions.

Managing Forms of Payment (FOP)

What Are the Different Forms of Payment?

Payment Description Automatic supplier payment Relates to any GDS booking paid by credit card (global FOP). The travel agency does not receive any payment from the customer; the booking is paid directly to the supplier. This is indicated on the invoice as ‘already paid’. Manual supplier payment Relates to manual bookings. These payments must be manually created to ensure that the invoice document correctly shows that it has already been paid. These payments appear in the Manual Payment to Supplier sub-section of the Form of Payment section of the Booking File. Travel agency payments Created during or after invoicing to indicate the amount due to the travel agency. These payments appear in the Payment to Travel Agency sub-section of the Form of Payment section of the Booking File.

What Are IATA Codes?

An IATA code is a unique three-letter code that is used to identify an airport or city. The codes are assigned and governed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

You use IATA codes to identify a location. However, you can also easily find hotels within a city or around an airport without any prior knowledge of IATA codes or find hotels in locations that are not IATA-coded.

What Are Geocoded Locations?

A geocoded location is one that has associated geographic coordinates (often expressed as latitude and longitude). The coordinates of a location are determined by geographic data; for example, address and postal code.

Amadeus Selling Platform Connect User Guide

The coordinates of a location can be embedded into media such as street maps. This enables you to show hotels on a map or 3D aerial photograph.

What Is a Landmark?

A landmark is sometimes referred to as a point of reference.

--- Chunk 1002 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
What Is a Landmark?

A landmark is sometimes referred to as a point of reference.

Note: The list is built using an Amadeus-specific list of references and business locations, together with data supplied by third party map providers. Consequently, Amadeus is unable to guarantee the accuracy of all references.

What Is a Property Code?

Each hotel stored in the Amadeus Central System has a property code that is composed of three parts:

¢ Hotel provider code.

¢ Location IATA code.

¢ Three-character code consisting of letters, digits, or both.

Examples: ILMSP753, RTNCEFRT, LWNCE003, DHDXBAHT

Understanding Margin Rules

In Margin Manager, you create rules that define how booking margins are calculated. A margin is an extra fee added to the booking cost if the booking details match certain conditions. For example, you could specify that a margin be added for all flights booked on a particular airline, or in a specific booking class, or during certain dates. There are two types of margin rule:

--- Chunk 1123 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
A mark-up rule is used to add a margin that increases the total or component price of the booking. The mark-up is included in the total price of the booking, and is not displayed to the customer as a separate line item.

A product fee rule adds a margin for a specific service to the cost of the booking. It is displayed to the customer as a separate line item.

You can specify a mark-up charge or product fee as either a percentage or a flat fee.

Working With Rules

What Is a Rule?

A margin rule allows a specific margin to be automatically calculated and assigned at the time of a booking, refund, or cancel. A margin can be a product fee or mark-up.

When you create a margin rule, you specify:

The margin amount, for example, flat fee or percentage

A description, such as the reason for the margin.

The criteria (also known as rule conditions) under which the rule is applied, for example the travel zone, validating carrier, booking class, and so on.

You can deactivate a rule when it no longer applies, and reactivate it again when needed.

1. If you are not already on the Rules page, click on the Rules button on the top right.

Why Deactivate a Rule?

--- Chunk 1126 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
3. You are asked to confirm deactivation. Click on Yes.

Note: A rule must be removed from all models it is part of before it can be deactivated.

Why Deactivate a Rule?

If you have two rules with identical criteria, they are said to overlap. Active rules are not permitted to overlap, so if you wish to create a new rule that overlaps with an existing one, you must deactivate the existing rule first.

When you create a rule, the system checks to make sure the new rule does not overlap with any other active rules. If it overlaps, an error message is displayed and the rule is not created.

This feature can be useful, for example, if you have certain promotions that you wish to activate periodically.

How to Reactivate a Rule

The list of deactivated rules matching your criteria is displayed.

Note: When you reactivate a rule, you must also add it to any models it is part of, even if before deactivation the rule was previously linked to a model.

If you are specifying a rule for an Air product and want it to be triggered by particular flight numbers, you can specify the numbers in the Flight Number field on the Rule Criteria II tab, with each number separated by acomma. Note however, that Margin Manager does not accept blanks or the character 0 (zero) in this field. So a flight displayed in cryptic as LH 002 must be entered as LH2.

Working With Markets

What Is a Market?

A market is composed of one or more geographical locations (regions, countries, states, cities and airports). The geographical locations are based on the IATA standard representation.

Margin Manager has a default market, World, that cannot be modified or deleted.

A market must be unique within an administrative office. In other words, you cannot create two markets that are exactly the same.

When you define markets, you can include and exclude locations to suit your margin requirements.

Here are some examples:

Paris only the city Paris is included.

North America and Central America includes the regions North America and Central America. All countries, cities and airports in North and Central America are automatically included in this market.

World excluding North America automatically includes all regions, countries, states, cities and airports in the World apart from those in North America.

Amadeus Selling Platform Connect User Guide

How to Define or Modify a Market

If you wish to specify that the rule applies to a particular market, then you must first define the relevant markets, so they are available in the Origin type and Destination type drop-downs in the Product Data II Tab. See How to Create a Rule on page 225.

1. Click on the Markets button in the top right corner of the screen.

In the New Market panel, enter the Market name and Description.

Under Market Content, select the option that describes the market content:

— Inthe case of Region, Country or State, select an appropriate value from the drop-down list.

Inthe case of City, or Airport, enter the IATA city code.

Click on Include to add the market to the Tree panel.

To exclude a market from a higher-level market, use the Exclude buttons:

For example, if you want to create a Europe market but do not want to include Switzerland:

Select Region and select Europe, the click on Include.

— Europe appears in the Tree panel.

--- Chunk 1135 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
For example, if you want to create a Europe market but do not want to include Switzerland:

Select Region and select Europe, the click on Include.

— Europe appears in the Tree panel.

Select Country and select Switzerland, then click on Exclude.

Switzerland appears as an excluded item from the Europe market.

ca { El G@ A Europe E] 9¢ SWITZERLAND

You can now apply rules to the market created. This market is available in the Origin type and Destination type fields in the Product data II tab when defining arule.

You cannot delete a market if it is linked to a rule.

Working With Models

What Is a Model?

A model is a set of rules that can be either linked to a specific customer (through their CSX profile) or that can be activated for a specific period of time.

Note: If two or more models have the same validity date range, an overlap error is shown.

1. Select the Model tab.

You can add rules to the model now, or save the model and add rules later.

Note: It is possible to create a model without linking rules to it. However, during the fee calculation process only active rules linked to a model are taken into consideration.

How Is a Rule Applied?

To decide which rules to apply to a booking, Margin Manager applies the following logic:

Model CSX profile selectedin| selected in Result PNR? PNR? Yes Yes 1. This model and the linked CSX profile are checked ior matching rules and the assigned CSX. 2. no matching rule is found, no rule is applied. Yes No 1. This model is checked for matching rules. 2. no matching rule is found, no rule is applied. No Yes 1. Any model linked to the CSX profile is checked for matching rules. 2. no matching rule is found, all other models which are not linked to a CSX profile are checked for matching rules. 3. no matching rule is found in any models, free rules are checked, and rules with linked CSX is checked No No 1. All models with no link to a CSX profile are checked ior matching rules. 2. no matching rule is found in any model, then all ree rules that are not linked to a CSX profile are checked.

--- Chunk 1138 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
Note: Since some customers may expect rule selection to behave differently from the explanation in the above table, it is recommended not to use “free rules” and “models in combination. If the TA wants to work with models, all the rules should be put in a model so that there are no "free rules" left. In other words, you would create one model, for example called “Default”, containing all free rules without any validity or CSX customer, then create additional models, with either different validities or different CSX profiles linked to them.

Chapter 9: Margin Manager

Note: In a cryptic window you can select a model in your PNR by using the command TFL to see a list of all models, and TFU/1234 to select a specific model. In Selling Platform Connect the list of models is shown in AllFares Plus.

Working With Competence Areas

What Is a Competence Area?

A competence area is the name given to the group of point-of-sales offices that can use the rules you create. These offices can be part of your agency chain or corporation, or they can be any offices for which you are the designated rules administrator.

--- Chunk 1139 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
Your administration office is responsible for a single competence area. To maintain the competence area, you add or delete offices or groups of offices as required:

¢ If your administration office is also a point-of-sale office, remember to include the office in your competence area.

¢ — If you become responsible for a new point-of-sale office, add the office to your competence area if it is not already part of one of your office groups.

¢ — If anoffice is no longer eligible to use the rules in your competence area, make sure that you remove it from your competence area.

How to View and Modify Office IDs Included in a Competence Area

Click on the Competence Area button at the top right corner of the screen.

The list of existing areas is shown in the Competence area details panel.

Applying Fees to Bookings

Once margin rules have been defined for your organisation, they are immediately available to the travel agents creating bookings. The agent can thus accurately communicate the estimated total price of a trip (fare + mark-up + service fee) during both the shopping and booking phases.

How to Request the Total Sales Price (Cryptic)

1. First create the booking and do a pricing using one of the regular pricing commands such as FXB or FXP.

Panel Mode

The request is interpreted as part of the existing screen that was modified and so the response is returned in the same context.

For example, you enter the following commands in 3270 Command page:

EXP

TOT

All commands are sent in Inline Mode, which means each command is executed in its own context.

However, the TQT response is a separate screen. Therefore, the page switches to

Panel Mode.

If you send an availability request from within the TQT response, it is interpreted as a simple update of the TQT response.

How to Display 3270 Command Page History

Use the scrollbar to see the previous command requests.

All fields previously modified in a response are highlighted in red.

What Is the User Key Buffer?

The 3270 Command page is not available while a request is being processed. The page only becomes available again after the response is displayed.

The user key buffer allows you to keep working while a request is being processed. All keyboard strokes that are typed during the processing of a request are stored in the buffer.

When the response is displayed, all stored keyboard strokes are then executed in chronological order.

All keys stored in the buffer are displayed under the last panel on the 3270 Command page.

Understanding Queues

What Is a Queue?

A queue is a holding area for Booking Files or messages that require further action at a later date or time. It is identified by a number from 1 to 99. Each queue can be divided into categories, which are numbered from 0 to 254. Some queues may also be further divided into four date ranges.

Some queue numbers are predetermined by Amadeus because of industry standards. Booking Files and messages are automatically placed in these predetermined queues by airlines, hotel companies, car companies, other providers and Amadeus.

--- Chunk 1201 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
Every office has its own queue bank. Travel agencies are automatically provided with 16 predefined queues and airline offices with 19 queues.

You can create additional queues where you can manually place Booking Files and messages that require follow-up. You can also select one category to be associated to your Amadeus sign, so that any Booking Files or messages you create will be placed in the appropriate queue in your assigned category.

Chapter 13: Queues

What Is a Queue List?

A queue list displays all queues corresponding to the travel agent's office ID and contains some or all of the following details:

Statement group call select Description The group instruction is used to group several questions in the Smart Flow prompt that are defined by the ask or select instructions. This allows you to include several questions in the same Smart Flow prompt rather than having separate prompts for each ask instruction. The group instruction can only contain ask and select instructions; it cannot contain any other instructions. The call instruction is used to call another Smart Flow from the running Smart Flow. The call instruction is followed by the name of the Smart Flow to call. You can also explicitly call either an office Smart Flow or a personal Smart Flow with the same name by defining either office or personal in the call syntax. Allows the user to select one option from a dropdown list of predefined options. The string with quotes between the words select and from is the question that appears in the prompt when a Smart Flow is running.

eoan Check for fax or email A paasenger should have an associated fax or email contact details if (Contact.where(ContactType == "E" OR ContactType == "F").count == @) { set status WARNING choose “Use one the options to add a fax number or email address” { when ("Call a smart flow to add a fax number") { call “Add fax" + when ("Call a Smart Flow to add an email address") { call “Add email" + + Delete |

This rule checks for an email address or fax contact element in the PNR. If no contact is found, a warning is displayed with options to either call a Smart Flow to add a fax number or call a Smart Flow to add an email address.

After a contact is added for the passenger, the if condition becomes false and the check is successful.

Understanding Checks and Trigger Commands

What Is a Check?

A check verifies if a condition in a Booking File is true or false during the execution of Quality Monitor.

The check can also define the corrective action when the condition is true. After Quality Monitor is executed, the booking flow is interrupted by a message or blocked, in which case the user must perform the corrective action in the Booking File or Command page.

Amadeus Selling Platform Connect User Guide

You can also define checks for information purposes only. These checks have no conditions so they are always true for every Booking File.

What Is the Quality Monitor Checklist?

In the Booking File and Command page, all the active checks are displayed to the user in the Quality Monitor checklist.

For example:

Quality Monitor Sof 5 toms checked + Chock all X Eno & Waming & Warming direct i+] @ Info Unchecked ~ Checked

The checks are ordered according to their status severity, starting with the most severe. The current status of each check is indicated by icon and colour. For more information, see What Are the Statuses of a Check? on page 340.

--- Chunk 1316 from very_useful_Agentbok_by_amadeus.pdf ---
If an error occurs during Quality Monitor execution, the top of the checklist shows:

¢ Anerror message.

¢ The name of the relevant check, as a link. You can click on this link to display the corresponding check overlay.

What Is a Trigger Command?

A trigger command is a cryptic command or equivalent graphical action that is used to trigger a rule. Each trigger and its equivalent action belong to a specific trigger command family, and only specific commands and actions are defined for each family.

The trigger family is defined in the Trigger field of the Quality Monitor Editor.

When a trigger command is entered or its equivalent graphical action performed, only

the rules defined for that trigger command are executed.

Any rules defined for other command families are not executed. Therefore, these rules remain in the same state as they were prior to the execution of the trigger command. You must click on the Check Alll link in the Quality Monitor checklist to see the most recent state of the checks.

Status Severity 4 Status Description Blocking If the condition for the check is true when Quality Monitor is executed, the check is displayed with a Blocking status. The state varies between Warning and Blocking depending on whether or nota trigger has been sent. Awarning only turns into a blocking state when a trigger command (such as ET or ETK) from the trigger family is entered. A blocking state check will block the Booking File. Therefore, the user must correct it before continuing with the associated trigger command. For example, if the check is defined for a pricing trigger command, the user cannot price until the blocking state is fixed. If the user mouseovers the Blocking state check, an overlay is displayed. If the user clicks on the check, the Validate button on the overlay display can be used to launch corrective actions. In the Quality Monitor checklist, checks with a Blocking status appear in red and are preceded by the X icon.

. Note: Ifa check has the Blocking status when the user tries to save a Booking File, an error message also appears advising the user to check the Quality Monitor checklist. Warning In the editor, a check is defined as a warning using the set status instruction. If the condition for the check is true when Quality Monitor is executed, the check is displayed with a Warning status. A Warning state is also called a Non-blocking state, which means that this check will not block the Booking File. Therefore, the user can continue with the booking without having to take any immediate action. If the user mouseovers the Warning state check, an overlay is displayed. If the user clicks on the check, the Validate button on the overlay display can be used to launch corrective actions. Refer to What Are the Corrective Actions for a Check? on page 341. In the Quality Monitor checklist, checks with a Warning status appear in blue and are preceded by the » icon.

Status Status Description Severity 3 Information the condition for the check is true when Quality Monitor is executed (or there is no condition in the check), the check is displayed with an INFO status. This state will not block the Booking File. the user mouseovers the Information state check, an overlay is displayed. If the user clicks on the check, the Validate button can be used to launch corrective actions. In the Quality Monitor checklist, checks with an Information status appear in blue and are preceded by thee icon. This is the state of a check immediately after the user opens a Booking File and before Quality Monitor is executed for the first time. tis also the state of a check if the checklist is refreshed by an Ignore or End Transaction. the Booking File is empty and the user click on the Check All link in the Quality Monitor checklist, every check remains in an unchecked state. Unchecked Success This is the state of a check when its condition is evaluated as false during the last execution of Quality Monitor. In the Quality Monitor checklist, checks with a Success status are preceded by the ~ icon.

What Are the Corrective Actions for a Check?

Manual Corrective Action

If the state of a check for a Booking File is Information, Warning or Blocking, corrective actions are displayed when the user clicks on or mouseovers the check.

The actions only appear if you use the choose... when statements when defining the check.

You can choose to:

¢ Call an existing office Smart Flow (a personal Smart Flow cannot be called).

¢ Call an existing Smart Tool (the Smart Tool must already be available in Selling Platform Connect).

¢ Send an editable cryptic command.

Note: When a corrective action is performed, Quality Monitor is not triggered automatically. The user must perform a manual check by clicking on the Check All link in the Quality Monitor checklist to refresh the state of each check.

Editing a Cryptic Command for a Manual Corrective Action

The command that was included in inverted commas after the send instruction appears in the editable text field of the corrective action overlay. The user can edit this command before sending it.

However, if the text field is left empty after editing, no cryptic command is sent when the user clicks on Validate in the overlay.
