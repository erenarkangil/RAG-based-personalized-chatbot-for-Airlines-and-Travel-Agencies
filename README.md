# RAG-based-personalized-chatbot-for-Airlines-and-Travel-Agencies
Helping travel agencies to understand complex ticketing rules not to get penalized



While ChatGPT and other LLMs are powerful, they struggle with highly specialized, rule-based domains like airline fare construction, ATPCO categories, or GDS violations.

That’s why I’ve been developing a domain-specific assistant:FareGuard.AI 
a personalized AI trained specifically on public ATPCO, IATA, and GDS materials, making it aware of the nuances that general-purpose models overlook.

👇 Below is a side-by-side comparison between ChatGPT and my model when asked the same fare rule question.

You’ll notice ChatGPT either:
Hallucinates a response
Or confidently says: “I don’t know”

Whereas FareGuard understands the structure and intent of actual fare rules, empowering agents to interpret them without risk of costly errors like ADMs.
I’d love to hear feedback from anyone working in:
Airline revenue management
Fare audit & policy teams
GDS/travel tech
Or anyone who's faced the ADM pain firsthand
Looking forward to suggestions or improvements!
